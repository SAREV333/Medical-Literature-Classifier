Age and renal clearance of cimetidine.;In 35 patients (ages 20 to 86 yr) receiving cimetidine therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of cimetidine by high-pressure liquid chromatography and for creatinine. Cimetidine clearance decreased with age. The extrapolated 6-hr serum concentration of cimetidine per unit dose, after intravenous cimetidine, increased with age of the patients. The ratio of cimetidine clearance to creatinine clearance (Rc) averaged 4.8 +/- 2.0, indicating net tubular secretion for cimetidine. Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of cimetidine, suggesting that secretion of cimetidine is a saturable process. There was only one case of dementia possibly due to cimetidine (with a drug level of 1.9 microgram/ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had cimetidine levels above 1.25 microgram/ml. Thus, high cimetidine levels alone do not always induce dementia.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Cis and trans effects of the myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) mutation in a cell culture model.;The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) has been identified as a CTG expansion in the 3-untranslated region ( 3-UTR ) of the DM protein kinase gene ( DMPK ) , but the mechanism ( s ) of pathogenesis remain unknown . Studies using DM patient materials have often produced confusing results . Therefore , to study the effects of the DM mutation in a controlled environment , we have established a cell culture model system using C2C12 mouse myoblasts . By expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human DMPK 3-UTR , we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the DM mutation . Our data show that a mutant DMPK 3-UTR , with as few as 57 CTGs , had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci . We determined by deletion analysis that an expanded ( CTG ) ( n ) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects . Furthermore , in contrast to the normal DMPK 3-UTR mRNA , a mutant DMPK 3-UTR mRNA with ( CUG ) ( 200 ) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts . Genetic analysis and the Cre- loxP system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion defect could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant DMPK 3-UTR transcript . Characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the ( CTG ) ( n ) expansion and / or the 3 end of the DMPK 3-UTR . These results provide evidence that the DM mutation acts in cis to reduce protein production ( consistent with DMPK haploinsufficiency ) and in trans as a riboregulator to inhibit myogenesis . .;neurological;['neurological']
Molecular basis of human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency causing cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood.;"beta-Oxidation of long-chain fatty acids provides the major source of energy in the heart . Defects in enzymes of the beta-oxidation pathway cause sudden , unexplained death in childhood , acute hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure , skeletal myopathy , and cardiomyopathy . Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [ VLCAD ; very-long-chain-acyl-CoA  ( acceptor ) 2 , 3-oxidoreductase , EC 1 . 3 3 . 99 99 . 13 ] catalyzes the first step in beta-oxidation . We have isolated the human VLCAD cDNA and gene and determined the complete nucleotide sequences . Polymerase chain reaction amplification of VLCAD mRNA and genomic exons defined the molecular defects in two patients with VLCAD deficiency who presented with unexplained cardiac arrest and cardiomyopathy . In one , a homozygous mutation in the consensus dinucleotide of the donor splice site ( g + 1-- > a ) was associated with universal skipping of the prior exon ( exon 11 ) . The second patient was a compound heterozygote , with a missense mutation , C1837-- > T , changing the arginine at residue 613 to tryptophan on one allele and a single base deletion at the intron-exon 6 boundary as the second mutation . This initial delineation of human mutations in VLCAD suggests that VLCAD deficiency reduces myocardial fatty acid beta-oxidation and energy production and is associated with cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood .";cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']

All- trans-retinoic acid-induced erythema nodosum in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.;Erythema nodosum associated with all- trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is very rare. We describe four patients with classic APL who developed erythema nodosum during ATRA therapy. Fever and subsequent multiple painful erythematous nodules over extremities developed on D11, D16, D17, and D19, respectively, after ATRA therapy. The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with erythema nodosum. All patients received short course of steroids. Fever subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely. All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of ATRA. ATRA seemed to be the most possible etiology of erythema nodosum in our patients. Short-term use of steroid is very effective in ATRA-induced erythema nodosum.;oncological;['oncological']

Aconitine-induced Ca2+ overload causes arrhythmia and triggers apoptosis through p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rats.;Aconitine is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants. Emerging evidence indicates that voltage-dependent Na(+) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine. However, no reports are available on the role of Ca(2+) in aconitine poisoning. In this study, we explored the importance of pathological Ca(2+) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo. We found that Ca(2+) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats. To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury, we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats. The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose-dependently. To confirm the pro-apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometric detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay. The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time-dependently. The expression analysis of Ca(2+) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca(2+) overload through the expression regulation of Ca(2+) handling proteins. The expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that pro-apoptotic protein expression was upregulated, and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 expression was downregulated. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members, especially the P-P38/P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues. Hence, our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca(2+) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.;neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']

Frequency of appearance of myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) in Graves' disease patients treated with propylthiouracil and the relationship between MPO-ANCA and clinical manifestations.;OBJECTIVE: Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-positive vasculitis has been reported in patients with Graves' disease who were treated with propylthiouracil (PTU). The appearance of MPO-ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to PTU because the titres of MPO-ANCA decreased when PTU was stopped. Nevertheless, there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO-ANCA and vasculitis during PTU therapy, or on the incidence of MPO-ANCA in untreated Graves' disease patients. Therefore, we sought to address these parameters in patients with Graves' disease. PATIENTS: We investigated 102 untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease for the presence of MPO-ANCA, and for the development vasculitis after starting PTU therapy. Twenty-nine of them were later excluded because of adverse effects of PTU or because the observation period was less than 3 months. The remaining 73 patients (55 women and 18 men), all of whom were examined for more than 3 months, were adopted as the subjects of the investigation. The median observation period was 23.6 months (range: 3-37 months). MEASUREMENTS: MPO-ANCA was measured at intervals of 2-6 months. RESULTS: Before treatment, the MPO-ANCA titres of all 102 untreated Graves' disease patients were within the reference range (below 10 U/ml). Three (4.1%) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO-ANCA at 13, 16 and 17 months, respectively, after the start of PTU therapy. In two of them, the MPO-ANCA titres transiently increased to 12.8 and 15.0 U/ml, respectively, despite continued PTU therapy, but no vasculitic disorders developed. In the third patient, the MPO-ANCA titre increased to 204 U/ml and she developed a higher fever, oral ulcers and polyarthralgia, but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping PTU therapy, and the MPO-ANCA titre decreased to 20.7 U/ml by 4 months after discontinuing PTU. CONCLUSIONS: PTU therapy may be related to the appearance of MPO-ANCA, but MPO-ANCA does not appear to be closely related to vasculitis.;neurological;['neurological']

Dose-related beneficial and adverse effects of dietary corticosterone on organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy in chickens.;Tri-ortho-tolyl phosphate (TOTP), 360 mg/kg, po, and 0,0'-diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP), 1 mg/kg sc, were administered to adult White Leghorn chickens 24 hr after they were placed on diets containing 0 to 300 ppm corticosterone. Supplemented diets were continued until clinical signs and lesions of delayed neuropathy appeared. Although low concentrations (less than or equal to 50 ppm) of corticosterone had beneficial effects on TOTP-induced neuropathy, greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either TOTP or DFP. Neurotoxic esterase activities 24 hr after TOTP or DFP were less than 20% of values measured in chickens not given organophosphorous compounds. Chickens given 200 ppm corticosterone without TOTP or DFP had significantly elevated activity of plasma cholinesterase and significantly inhibited activity of liver carboxylesterase. Degenerating myelinated fibers were also evident in distal levels of the peripheral nerves of chickens given TOTP or DFP.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

A high incidence of BRCA1 mutations in 20 breast-ovarian cancer families.;We have analyzed 20 breast-ovarian cancer families , the majority of which show positive evidence of linkage to chromosome 17q12 for germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 gene . BRCA1 mutations cosegregating with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility were identified in 16 families , including 1 family with a case of male breast cancer . Nine of these mutations have not been reported previously . The majority of mutations were found to generate a premature stop codon leading to the formation of a truncated BRCA1 protein of 2 % -88 % of the expected normal length . Two mutations altered the RING finger domain . Sequencing of genomic DNA led to the identification of a mutation in the coding region of BRCA1 in 12 families , and cDNA analysis revealed an abnormal or missing BRCA1 transcript in 4 of the 8 remaining families . A total of eight mutations were associated with a reduced quantity of BRCA1 transcript . We were unable to detect BRCA1 mutations in 4 of the 20 families , but only 1 of these was clearly linked to BRCA1 . It is expected that the majority of clear examples of the breast-ovarian syndrome will be associated with germ-line mutations in the coding region of BRCA1 . .;oncological;['oncological']

Further evidence for a major ancient mutation underlying myotonic dystrophy from linkage disequilibrium studies in the Japanese population.;The myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) mutation is an unstable ( CTG ) n repeat , present at a copy number of 5-37 repeats on normal chromosomes but amplified to 50-3000 copies on DM chromosomes . Previous findings in Caucasian populations of a DM founder chromosome raise a question about the molecular events involved in the expansion mutation . To investigate whether a founder chromosome for the DM mutation exists in the Japanese population , we genotyped families using polymorphic markers near the ( CTG ) n repeat region and constructed haplotypes . Six different haplotypes were found and DM alleles were always haplotype A . To find an origin of the ( CTG ) n repeat mutation and to investigate the mechanism of the expansion mutation in the Japanese population we have studied 90 Japanese DM families comprising 190 affected and 130 unaffected members . The results suggest that a few common ancestral mutations in both Caucasian and Japanese populations have originated by expansion of an ancestral n = 5 repeat to n = 19-37 copies . These data support multistep models of triplet repeat expansion that have been proposed for both DM and Friedreichs ataxia . .;neurological;['neurological']

Valsartan, a new angiotensin II antagonist for the treatment of essential hypertension: a comparative study of the efficacy and safety against amlodipine.;"OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin II antagonist, valsartan, with a reference therapy, amlodipine. METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double-blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks. After 8 weeks of therapy, in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled, 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy. Patients were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks. Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates. RESULTS: Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Similar decreases were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed. For the primary variable the difference was 0.5 mm Hg in favor of valsartan (p = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, -2.7 to 1.7). Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66.7% for valsartan and 60.2% for amlodipine (p = 0.39). Both treatments were well tolerated. The incidence of drug-related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group, particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day (2.4% for 80 mg valsartan; 3.6% for 5 mg amlodipine; 0% for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine; 14.3% for 10 mg amlodipine). CONCLUSIONS: The data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. The results also show valsartan to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists.";cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']

Phase II study of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.;"BACKGROUND: The activity of the combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin was tested in a Phase II study of patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma. METHODS: The combination of carboplatin (area under the concentration curve [AUC], 5) and liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil; starting dose, 40 mg/m(2)) was administered intravenously every 28 days to 37 patients with recurrent squamous cell cervical carcinoma to determine antitumor activity and toxicity profile. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were assessable for response, and 35 patients were assessable for toxicity. The overall response rate was 38%, the median time to response was 10 weeks, the median duration of response was 26 weeks, and the median survival was 37 weeks. The main toxic effect was myelosuppression, with Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in 16 patients, anemia in 12 patients, thrombocytopenia in 11 patients, and neutropenic fever in 3 patients. Four patients had five infusion-related reactions during the infusion of liposomal doxorubicin, leading to treatment discontinuation in three patients. Grade > or = 2 nonhematologic toxicity included nausea in 17 patients, emesis in 14 patients, fatigue in 9 patients, mucositis and/or stomatitis in 8 patients, constipation in 6 patients, weight loss in 5 patients, hand-foot syndrome in 2 patients, and skin reactions in 3 patients.

Ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.;"We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years. Thirty-six of the 210 patients (17.2%) developed iridocyclitis. Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients (0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis. However, 30% of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age. Although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active uveitis on entry. Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases. Forty-four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or photophobia, in order of decreasing frequency. Even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics. Despite this, there was a dramatic decrease in the 50% incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies. Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13% of our group, respectively. We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs. Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found. Typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases. This association with uveitis and JRA was not noted previously. Surgical treatment of cataracts, band keratopathy, and glaucoma achieved uniformly discouraging results.";neurological;['neurological']
Norepinephrine signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of cocaine-induced anxiety.;BACKGROUND: Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties. While the mechanisms underlying cocaine's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine, such as anxiety. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine-induced anxiety. RESULTS: We found that cocaine dose-dependently increased anxiety-like behavior in control (Dbh +/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration. The Dbh -/- mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. Cocaine-induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh +/- mice following administration of disulfiram, a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine-induced anxiety-like behavior in Dbh +/- and wild-type C57BL6/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist prazosin and the alpha(2) antagonist yohimbine had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta-adrenergic receptors is required for cocaine-induced anxiety in mice.;neurological;['neurological']
MR imaging with quantitative diffusion mapping of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity in organ transplant patients.;Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during tacrolimus therapy. Brain MR studies, including DW imaging, were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications. In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study, a follow-up MR study was performed 1 month later. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions. Of the 14 patients, 5 (35.7%) had white matter abnormalities, 1 (7.1%) had putaminal hemorrhage, and 8 (57.1%) had normal findings on initial MR images. Among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities, 4 patients (80.0%) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images, and all showed complete resolution on follow-up images. The remaining 1 patient (20.0%) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with cortical laminar necrosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity.;neurological;['neurological']
Ifosfamide related encephalopathy: the need for a timely EEG evaluation.;"BACKGROUND: Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent useful in the treatment of a wide range of cancers including sarcomas, lymphoma, gynecologic and testicular cancers. Encephalopathy has been reported in 10-40% of patients receiving high-dose IV ifosfamide. OBJECTIVE: To highlight the role of electroencephalogram (EEG) in the early detection and management of ifosfamide related encephalopathy. METHODS: Retrospective chart review including clinical data and EEG recordings was done on five patients, admitted to MD Anderson Cancer Center between years 2009 and 2012, who developed ifosfamide related acute encephalopathy. RESULTS: All five patients experienced symptoms of encephalopathy soon after (within 12 h-2 days) receiving ifosfamide. Two patients developed generalized convulsions while one patient developed continuous non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) that required ICU admission and intubation. Initial EEG showed epileptiform discharges in three patients; run of triphasic waves in one patient and moderate degree diffuse generalized slowing. Mixed pattern with the presence of both sharps and triphasic waves were also noted. Repeat EEGs within 24_h of symptom onset showed marked improvement that was correlated with clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of ifosfamide related encephalopathy correlates with EEG changes. We suggest a timely EEG evaluation for patients receiving ifosfamide who develop features of encephalopathy.";neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']
Mutation of MSH3 in endometrial cancer and evidence for its functional role in heteroduplex repair.;Many human tumours have length alterations in repetitive sequence elements . Although this microsatellite instability has been attributed to mutations in four DNA mismatch repair genes in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) kindreds , many sporadic tumours exhibit instability but no detectable mutations in these genes . It is therefore of interest to identify other genes that contribute to this instability . In yeast , mutations in several genes , including RTH and MSH3 , cause microsatellite instability . Thus , we screened 16 endometrial carcinomas with microsatellite instability for alterations in FEN1 ( the human homolog of RTH ) and in MSH3 ( refs 12-14 ) . Although we found no FEN1 mutations , a frameshift mutation in MSH3 was observed in an endometrial carcinoma and in an endometrial carcinoma cell line . Extracts of the cell line were deficient in repair of DNA substrates containing mismatches or extra nucleotides . Introducing chromosome 5 , encoding the MSH3 gene , into the mutant cell line increased the stability of some but not all microsatellites . Extracts of these cells repaired certain substrates containing extra nucleotides , but were deficient in repair of those containing mismatches or other extra nucleotides . A subsequent search revealed a second gene mutation in HHUA cells , a missense mutation in the MSH6 gene . Together the data suggest that the MSH3 gene encodes a product that functions in repair of some but not all pre-mutational intermediates , its mutation in tumours can result in genomic instability and , as in yeast , MSH3 and MSH6 are partially redundant for mismatch repair . .;neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']

Iatrogenic risks of endometrial carcinoma after treatment for breast cancer in a large French case-control study. F  d  ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC).;Since tamoxifen is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer, its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined. We have investigated the association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast cancer in a case-control study. Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001). After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for tamoxifen users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Women who had endometrial cancer and had received tamoxifen had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment. Our results suggest a causal role of tamoxifen in endometrial cancer, particularly when used as currently proposed for breast cancer prevention. Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with breast cancer. Endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with tamoxifen have poorer prognosis. Women who receive tamoxifen for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment.

Risk of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy in cancer patients who received continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil with the complication of dehydration and infection.;From 1986 to 1998, 29 cancer patients who had 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were identified. None of the patients had decompensated liver disease. Onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy varied from 0.5 to 5 days (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.3 days) after the initiation of chemotherapy. Plasma ammonium level ranged from 248 to 2387 microg% (mean: 626 +/- 431 microg%). Among the 32 episodes, 26 (81%) had various degrees of azotemia, 18 (56%) occurred during bacterial infections and 14 (44%) without infection occurred during periods of dehydration. Higher plasma ammonium levels and more rapid onset of hyperammonemia were seen in 18 patients with bacterial infections (p=0.003 and 0.0006, respectively) and in nine patients receiving high daily doses (2600 or 1800 mg/m2) of 5-FU (p=0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively). In 25 out of 32 episodes (78%), plasma ammonium levels and mental status returned to normal within 2 days after adequate management. In conclusion, hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU. Azotemia, body fluid insufficiency and bacterial infections were frequently found in these patients. It is therefore important to recognize this condition in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU.;hepatorenal|oncological;['hepatorenal', 'oncological']

Characterization of estrogen-induced adenohypophyseal tumors in the Fischer 344 rat.;Pituitary tumors were induced in F344 female rats by chronic treatment with diethylstilbestrol (DES, 8-10 mg) implanted subcutaneously in silastic capsules. Over a range of 1-150 days of DES treatment, pairs of control and DES-treated rats were sacrificed, and their pituitaries dissociated enzymatically into single-cell preparations. The cell populations were examined regarding total cell recovery correlated with gland weight, intracellular prolactin (PRL) content and subsequent release in primary culture, immunocytochemical PRL staining, density and/or size alterations via separation on Ficoll-Hypaque and by unit gravity sedimentation, and cell cycle analysis, after acriflavine DNA staining, by laser flow cytometry. Total cell yields from DES-treated pituitaries increased from 1.3 times control yields at 8 days of treatment to 58.9 times control values by day 150. Intracellular PRL content ranged from 1.9 to 9.4 times control levels, and PRL release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls, after at least 8 days of DES exposure. Beyond 8 days of DES exposure, the immunochemically PRL-positive proportion of cells increased to over 50% of the total population. Increased density and/or size and PRL content were indicated for the majority of the PRL cell population in both types of separation protocols. All these effects of DES were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized animals. The data extend the findings of other investigators, further establishing the DES-induced tumor as a model for study of PRL cellular control mechanisms.;neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']

Mechanisms for protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin-mediated nephropathy in rats.;Studies were performed to examine the mechanisms for the protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin (GM)-mediated nephropathy. Administration of GM at 40 mg/kg sc for 13 days to rats induced a significant reduction in renal blood flow (RBF) and inulin clearance (CIn) as well as marked tubular damage. A significant reduction in urinary guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) excretion and a significant increase in renal cortical renin and endothelin-1 contents were also observed in GM-mediated nephropathy. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) or dimethylthiourea (DMTU) significantly lessened the GM-induced decrement in CIn. The SOD-induced increase in glomerular filtration rate was associated with a marked improvement in RBF, an increase in urinary cGMP excretion, and a decrease in renal renin and endothelin-1 content. SOD did not attenuate the tubular damage. In contrast, DMTU significantly reduced the tubular damage and lipid peroxidation, but it did not affect renal hemodynamics and vasoactive substances. Neither SOD nor DMTU affected the renal cortical GM content in GM-treated rats. These results suggest that 1) both SOD and DMTU have protective effects on GM-mediated nephropathy, 2) the mechanisms for the protective effects differ for SOD and DMTU, and 3) superoxide anions play a critical role in GM-induced renal vasoconstriction.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Since the donor of one of these biopsies has a large deletion of the 5-region of the DMD gene , our results argue against the recent proposal that nebulin is the gene mutated in DMD . .;neurological;['neurological']
The dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-associated collagen type Ialpha1/platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain fusion gene generates a transforming protein that is processed to functional PDGF-BB.;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ( DFSP ) displays chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 and 22 , which fuse the collagen type Ialpha1 ( COLIA1 ) gene to the platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) B-chain ( PDGFB ) gene . To characterize the functional and structural properties of the COLIA1 / PDGFB fusion protein , we generated a stable NIH3T3 cell line that contained a tumor-derived chimeric gene resulting from a COIA1 intron 7-PDGFB intron 1 fusion . Expression of the fusion protein led to morphological transformation and increased growth rate of these cells . The PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor CGP57148B reversed the transformed phenotype and reduced the growth rate of COLIA1 / PDGFB-expressing cells but had no effects on control cells . The presence of dimeric COLIA1 / PDGFB precursors was demonstrated through PDGFB immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled cells and also by PDGFB immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with COLIA1 antibodies . Pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the COLIA1 / PDGFB precursor was processed to an end product that was indistinguishable from wild-type PDGF-BB . Finally , COLIA1 / PDGFB-expressing cells generated tumors after s . c c . injection into nude mice , and tumor growth was reduced by treatment with CGP57148B . We conclude that the COLIA1 / PDGFB fusion associated with DFSP contributes to tumor development through ectopic production of PDGF-BB and the formation of an autocrine loop . Our findings , thus , suggest that PDGF receptors could be a target for pharmacological treatment of DFSP and giant cell fibroblastoma , e . g . , through the use of PDGF receptor kinase inhibitors such as CGP57148B .;oncological;['oncological']

Longitudinal association of alcohol use with HIV disease progression and psychological health of women with HIV.;We evaluated the association of alcohol consumption and depression, and their effects on HIV disease progression among women with HIV. The study included 871 women with HIV who were recruited from 1993-1995 in four US cities. The participants had physical examination, medical record extraction, and venipuncture, CD4+T-cell counts determination, measurement of depression symptoms (using the self-report Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale), and alcohol use assessment at enrollment, and semiannually until March 2000. Multilevel random coefficient ordinal models as well as multilevel models with joint responses were used in the analysis. There was no significant association between level of alcohol use and CD4+ T-cell counts. When participants were stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, the association between alcohol and CD4+ T-cell did not reach statistical significance. The association between alcohol consumption and depression was significant (p<0.001). Depression had a significant negative effect on CD4+ T-cell counts over time regardless of ART use. Our findings suggest that alcohol consumption has a direct association with depression. Moreover, depression is associated with HIV disease progression. Our findings have implications for the provision of alcohol use interventions and psychological resources to improve the health of women with HIV.;neurological;['neurological']
Potential deleterious effect of furosemide in radiocontrast nephropathy.;The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of furosemide in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy. 18 patients, referred to a radiocontrast study, considered at risk because of preexisting renal insufficiency, were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, performed at the secondary care center of a 1,100-bed private university hospital. In addition to fluids, the treatment group received furosemide (mean dose 110 mg) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material. The control group received fluids (mean 3 liters). Radiological studies were mostly angiographies performed with both ionic and non-ionic contrast material, at an average dose of 245 ml. Renal function significantly deteriorated in the group pretreated with furosemide (p < 0.005 by ANOVA), with a rise in serum creatinine from 145 +/- 13 to 182 +/- 16 mumol/l at 24 h, while no change occurred in the control group (from 141 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 7 mumol/l). Renal failure was associated with weight loss in the furosemide-treated group. Furosemide may be deleterious in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Comparison of the effect of oxitropium bromide and of slow-release theophylline on nocturnal asthma.;The effects of a new inhaled antimuscarinic drug, oxitropium bromide, and of a slow-release theophylline preparation upon nocturnal asthma were compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind study. Two samples were studied: 12 patients received oxitropium at 600 micrograms (6 subjects) or at 400 micrograms t.i.d. (6 subjects) whereas 11 received theophylline at 300 mg b.i.d. Morning dipping, assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight, was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken, whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration. No significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug, as well as with either dosage of oxitropium. No subject reported side effects of oxitropium, as compared to three subjects reporting nausea, vomiting and tremors after theophylline. Oxitropium proves to be a valuable alternative to theophylline in nocturnal asthma, since it is equally potent, safer and does not require the titration of dosage.;neurological;['neurological']

Endocrine screening in 1,022 men with erectile dysfunction: clinical significance and cost-effective strategy.;PURPOSE: We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay. Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire, gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml. Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results. Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1,340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination. Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire, small testes and gynecomastia. Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia. RESULTS: Testosterone was less than 3 ng./ml. in 107 patients but normal in 40% at repeat determination. The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age (4% before age 50 years and 9% 50 years or older). Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination. Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%). Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low testosterone, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy. Prolactin exceeded 20 ng./ml. in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination. Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered. These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades (overall prolactin greater than 20 ng./ml. in 1.86% of 1,821 patients, prolactinomas in 7, 0.38%). Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. (8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng./ml.). Testosterone was low in less than 50% of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination. However, cost-effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50% of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors. We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years. Prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire, gynecomastia and/or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml.;oncological;['oncological']
Two new arylsulfatase A (ARSA) mutations in a juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) patient.;Fragments of the arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) gene from a patient with juvenile-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) were amplified by PCR and ligated into MP13 cloning vectors . Clones hybridizing with cDNA for human ARSA were selected , examined for appropriate size inserts , and used to prepare single-stranded phage DNA . Examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations . One , a point mutation in exon 3 , resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine . Introduction of this alteration into the normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in ARSA activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells . About 5 % of the control expression was observed , suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated ARSA . The second mutation , a G-to-A transition , occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron . The mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site . Apparently normal levels of mRNA were generated from this allele , but no ARSA activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected . A collection of DNA samples from known or suspected MLD patients , members of their families , and normal controls was screened for these mutations . Four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 MLD patients in the sample . Gene segregation in the original patients family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data . No individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified . However , combinations with other MLD mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late-onset forms of the disease . The splice-site mutation following exon 7 produces late-infantile MLD when combined with other enzyme-null mutations , implying that it is completely silent enzymatically . .;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling.;Methamphetamine (METH) damages dopamine (DA) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated. Cardona et al. [Nat. Neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of MPTP-induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons. Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation. Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with METH and examined for striatal neurotoxicity. METH depleted DA, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild-type controls. The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender-dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum. Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation. This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP-microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH. We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation. Furthermore, it appears that striatal-resident microglia respond to METH with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration.;neurological;['neurological']
Color vision defects in adrenomyeloneuropathy.;The relationship between abnormal color vision and adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) was investigated in 27 AMN patients and 31 age-matched controls by using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test . Twelve ( 44 % ) of 27 patients showed test scores significantly above normal . The axes of bipolarity determined by the testing differed widely between the patients with abnormal scores , compatible with the notion that different alterations in visual pigment genes occur in different AMN kindreds . These observations confirm our earlier impression that the frequency of abnormal color vision is increased in these kindreds , and it supports our contentions that ( 1 ) AMN ( and its companion , adrenoleukodystrophy ) are very closely linked to the visual pigment loci at Xq28 and ( 2 ) this proximity might provide the opportunity to observe contiguous gene defects . .;neurological;['neurological']

Effects of the novel compound aniracetam (Ro 13-5057) upon impaired learning and memory in rodents.;"The effect of aniracetam (Ro 13-5057, 1-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone) was studied on various forms of experimentally impaired cognitive functions (learning and memory) in rodents and produced the following effects: (1) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal hypercapnia immediately before the acquisition session; (2) partial (rats) or complete (mice) prevention of the scopolamine-induced short-term amnesia for a passive avoidance task; (3) complete protection against amnesia for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition; (4) prevention of the long-term retention- or retrieval-deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by chloramphenicol or cycloheximide administered immediately after acquisition; (5) reversal, when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test, of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by cycloheximide injected 2 days previously; (6) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or hypercapnia applied immediately before retrieval testing (24 h after acquisition). These improvements or normalizations of impaired cognitive functions were seen at oral aniracetam doses of 10-100 mg/kg. Generally, the dose-response curves were bell-shaped. The mechanisms underlying the activity of aniracetam and its 'therapeutic window' are unknown. Piracetam, another pyrrolidinone derivative was used for comparison. It was active only in six of nine tests and had about one-tenth the potency of aniracetam. The results indicate that aniracetam improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process.";neurological;['neurological']

Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis.;Hepatocyte tight junctions (TJs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation. Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information. Recently, several TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized. Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability. We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol (EE) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation (BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage. Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion. In contrast, 7H6 and ZO-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL. Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL. After EE treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule. This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and EE treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Effects of a new calcium antagonist, CD-832, on isoproterenol-induced myocardial ischemia in dogs with partial coronary stenosis.;Effects of CD-832 on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemia were studied in dogs with partial coronary stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery and findings were compared with those for nifedipine or diltiazem. In the presence of coronary artery stenosis, 3-min periods of intracoronary ISO infusion (10 ng/kg/min) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise, which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and ST-segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram. After the control ISO infusion with stenosis was performed, equihypotensive doses of CD-832 (3 and 10 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7), nifedipine (1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min, n = 9) or diltiazem (10 and 30 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7) were infused 5 min before and during the second and third ISO infusion. Both CD-832 and diltiazem, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced the increase in heart rate induced by ISO infusion. In contrast to nifedipine, CD-832 (10 micrograms/kg/min) prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 32 +/- 12% to 115 +/- 26% of the control value (P < .01) and ST-segment elevation from 5.6 +/- 1.0 mV to 1.6 +/- 1.3 mV (P < .01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis. Diltiazem (30 micrograms/kg/min) also prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 34 +/- 14% to 63 +/- 18% of the control value (P < .05) and ST-segment elevation from 4.7 +/- 0.7 mV to 2.1 +/- 0.7 mV (P < .01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis. These data show that CD-832 improves myocardial ischemia during ISO infusion with stenosis and suggest that the negative chronotropic property of CD-832 plays a major role in the beneficial effects of CD-832.;neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']

Optimization of levodopa therapy.;"While there is no single correct starting dose for levodopa therapy, many individuals can be started on either the 25/100 or controlled-release formula, following the general rule not to attempt to titrate carbidopa-levodopa to the point of ""normality,"" which can lead to toxicity. The physician should also determine the proper use of any adjunctive medications; such combined therapy has become the standard approach to treatment. Following the initial period of therapy, emerging difficulties require a reassessment of therapeutic approaches, such as dosage adjustment or introduction of a dopamine agonist. Other possible adverse effects--such as gastrointestinal disorders, orthostatic hypotension, levodopa-induced psychosis, sleep disturbances or parasomnias, or drug interactions--also require carefully monitored individual treatment. Nonpharmacologic concerns can help the Parkinson's disease patient achieve and maintain optimal functioning, including daily exercise, physical therapy, and involvement with support groups.";neurological;['neurological']
Development of proteinuria after switch to sirolimus-based immunosuppression in long-term cardiac transplant patients.;"Calcineurin-inhibitor therapy can lead to renal dysfunction in heart transplantation patients. The novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug sirolmus (Srl) lacks nephrotoxic effects; however, proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation. In cardiac transplantation, the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown. In this study, long-term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl-based IS. Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil +/- steroids. Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0.13 g/day (range 0-5.7) preswitch to 0.23 g/day (0-9.88) at 24 months postswitch (p = 0.0024). Before the switch, 11.5% of patients had high-grade proteinuria (>1.0 g/day); this increased to 22.9% postswitch (p = 0.006). ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-releasing blocker (ARB) therapy reduced proteinuria development. Patients without proteinuria had increased renal function (median 42.5 vs. 64.1, p = 0.25), whereas patients who developed high-grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow-up (median 39.6 vs. 29.2, p = 0.125). Thus, proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to Srl, which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients. Srl should be used with ACEi/ARB therapy and patients monitored for proteinuria and increased renal dysfunction.";cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']
Inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial-portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback.;Nitroprusside-induced hypotension evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (irCRF) into the hypophysial-portal circulation. Portal plasma concentrations of neither arginine vasopressin nor oxytocin are significantly altered in this paradigm. Application of a delayed feedback signal, in the form of a 2-h systemic corticosterone infusion in urethane-anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis, is without effect on the resting secretion of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin at any corticosterone feedback dose tested. Resting irCRF levels are suppressed only at the highest corticosterone infusion rate, which resulted in systemic corticosterone levels of 40 micrograms/dl. Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to nitroprusside-induced hypotension is observed and occurs at a plasma corticosterone level between 8-12 micrograms/dl. These studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of irCRF release.;neurological;['neurological']

Phenobarbitone-induced enlargement of the liver in the rat: its relationship to carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis.;"The yield of severe cirrhosis of the liver (defined as a shrunken finely nodular liver with micronodular histology, ascites greater than 30 ml, plasma albumin less than 2.2 g/dl, splenomegaly 2-3 times normal, and testicular atrophy approximately half normal weight) after 12 doses of carbon tetrachloride given intragastrically in the phenobarbitone-primed rat was increased from 25% to 56% by giving the initial ""calibrating"" dose of carbon tetrachloride at the peak of the phenobarbitone-induced enlargement of the liver. At this point it was assumed that the cytochrome P450/CCl4 toxic state was both maximal and stable. The optimal rat size to begin phenobarbitone was determined as 100 g, and this size as a group had a mean maximum relative liver weight increase 47% greater than normal rats of the same body weight.

Classical galactosemia and mutations at the galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) gene.;Classical galactosemia is caused by a deficiency in activity of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase ( GALT ) , which , in turn , is caused by mutations at the GALT gene . The disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and , at the end of 1998 , more than 150 different base changes were recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups in 15 countries worldwide . The mutations most frequently cited are Q188R , K285N , S135L , and N314D . Q188R is the most common mutation in European populations or in those predominantly of European descent . Overall , it accounts for 60-70 % of mutant chromosomes , but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations . Individuals homoallelic for Q188R tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems . Globally , K285N is rarer , but in many European populations it can be found on 25-40 % of mutant chromosomes . It is invariably associated with a severe phenotype . S135L is found almost exclusively in African Americans . In vitro expression results are discrepant , but some individuals carrying S135L appear to exhibit GALT activity in some tissues . Duarte 1 ( or Los Angeles ) and Duarte 2 ( or Duarte ) variants carry the same amino acid substitution , N314D , even though D1 is associated with increased erythrocyte GALT activity and D2 with reduced activity . N314D is in linkage disequilibrium with other base changes that differ on the D1 and D2 alleles . N314D does not impair GALT activity in in vitro expression systems . However , there are differences in the abundance of GALT protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from D2 and D1 individuals . It is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the D1 and D2 alleles account for the different activities . The considerable genetic heterogeneity documented to date undoubtedly contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed in galactosemia . The additional effects of nonallelic variation and other constitutional factors on phenotypic variability remain to be elucidated . .;neurological;['neurological']
Genotype and phenotype in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency .;Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by thymine-uraciluria in homozygous deficient patients and has been associated with a variable clinical phenotype . In order to understand the genetic and phenotypic basis for DPD deficiency , we have reviewed 17 families presenting 22 patients with complete deficiency of DPD . In this group of patients , 7 different mutations have been identified , including 2 deletions [ 295-298delTCAT , 1897delC ] , 1 splice-site mutation [ IVS14 + 1G > A ) ] and 4 missense mutations ( 85T > C , 703C > T , 2658G > A , 2983G > T ) . Analysis of the prevalence of the various mutations among DPD patients has shown that the G-- > A point mutation in the invariant splice donor site is by far the most common ( 52 % ) , whereas the other six mutations are less frequently observed . A large phenotypic variability has been observed , with convulsive disorders , motor retardation and mental retardation being the most abundant manifestations . A clear correlation between the genotype and phenotype has not been established . An altered beta-alanine , uracil and thymine homeostasis might underlie the various clinical abnormalities encountered in patients with DPD deficiency .;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Thalidomide neuropathy in patients treated for metastatic prostate cancer.;We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using electrodiagnostic studies. Sixty-seven men with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer in an open-label trial of oral thalidomide underwent neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies (NCS) prior to and at 3-month intervals during treatment. NCS included recording of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) from median, radial, ulnar, and sural nerves. SNAP amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline, and the mean of the four was termed the SNAP index. A 40% decline in the SNAP index was considered clinically significant. Thalidomide was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic response. Of 67 patients initially enrolled, 24 remained on thalidomide for 3 months, 8 remained at 6 months, and 3 remained at 9 months. Six patients developed neuropathy. Clinical symptoms and a decline in the SNAP index occurred concurrently. Older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factors. Neuropathy may thus be a common complication of thalidomide in older patients. The SNAP index can be used to monitor peripheral neuropathy, but not for early detection.;neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']

Cefotetan-induced immune hemolytic anemia.;Immune hemolytic anemia due to a drug-adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. We describe a patient who developed anemia while receiving intravenous cefotetan. Cefotetan-dependent antibodies were detected in the patient's serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells. The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of cefotetan, suggesting the concomitant formation of warm-reactive autoantibodies. These observations, in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular hemolysis, are consistent with drug-induced hemolytic anemia, possibly involving both drug-adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms. This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all cephalosporins.;neurological;['neurological']
Proteomic analysis of striatal proteins in the rat model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.;L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is among the motor complications that arise in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients after a prolonged treatment with L-DOPA. To this day, transcriptome analysis has been performed in a rat model of LID [Neurobiol. Dis., 17 (2004), 219] but information regarding the proteome is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesion rat model of PD treated with saline, L-DOPA or bromocriptine using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS). Rats treated with L-DOPA were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of LID. Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS (LC/MS/MS). Out of these 67 proteins, LID significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta-crystalin, gamma-enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha-2 subunit. Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in LID.;neurological;['neurological']

Lamivudine is effective in suppressing hepatitis B virus DNA in Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen carriers: a placebo-controlled trial.;Lamivudine is a novel 2',3'-dideoxy cytosine analogue that has potent inhibitory effects on hepatitis B virus replication in vitro and in vivo. We performed a single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess its effectiveness and safety in Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Forty-two Chinese HBsAg carriers were randomized to receive placebo (6 patients) or lamivudine orally in dosages of 25 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg daily (12 patients for each dosage). The drug was given for 4 weeks. The patients were closely monitored clinically, biochemically, and serologically up to 4 weeks after drug treatment. All 36 patients receiving lamivudine had a decrease in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA values of >90% (P < .001 compared with placebo). Although 25 mg of lamivudine was slightly less effective than 100 mg (P = .011) and 300 mg (P = .005), it still induced 94% suppression of HBV DNA after the fourth week of therapy. HBV DNA values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy. There was no change in the hepatitis B e antigen status or in aminotransferase levels. No serious adverse events were observed. In conclusion, a 4-week course of lamivudine was safe and effective in suppression of HBV DNA in Chinese HBsAg carriers. The suppression was >90% but reversible. Studies with long-term lamivudine administration should be performed to determine if prolonged suppression of HBV DNA can be achieved.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']
Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not doxorubicin.;"PURPOSE: The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use. Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity. If successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy.";neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;['neurological', 'cardiovascular', 'oncological']

The use and toxicity of didanosine (ddI) in HIV antibody-positive individuals intolerant to zidovudine (AZT);"One hundred and fifty-one patients intolerant to zidovudine (AZT) received didanosine (ddI) to a maximum dose of 12.5 mg/kg/day. Patient response was assessed using changes in CD4+ lymphocyte subset count, HIV p24 antigen, weight, and quality of life. Seventy patients developed major opportunistic infections whilst on therapy; this was the first AIDS diagnosis in 17. Only minor changes in CD4+ lymphocyte subset count were observed in AIDS patients, although a more significant rise occurred in those with earlier stages of disease. Of those positive for p24 antigen at the commencement of the study 67% showed a positive response, and this was most likely in those with CD4+ lymphocyte subset counts above 100 mm3. A positive weight response was seen in 16% of patients. Most patients showed improvement in individual parameters and global score of quality of life. Adverse reactions possibly attributable to didanosine were common. The most common side-effect was diarrhoea, which resulted in cessation of therapy in 19 individuals. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 12 patients and pancreatitis in six. Thirteen patients developed a raised serum amylase without abdominal pain. Seven patients developed glucose tolerance curves characteristic of diabetes but these were mild, did not require treatment and returned to normal on ceasing didanosine.";neurological;['neurological']

The hemodynamics of oxytocin and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery: findings in six cases.;"Oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension, particularly when given as a bolus. The resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return. Parturients with normal volume status, heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volume. Oxytocin-induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss. Pulse power analysis (also called ""pulse contour analysis"") of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time, thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure. Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia. Hypotension in response to oxytocin was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in stroke volume, heart rate and cardiac output. Pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating hypotension during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia.";cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']

Hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement in man.;II. Biological properties of C5-deficient human serum. The first known human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement ( C5 ) was documented in the accompanying report . This study examines several biological properties of C5-deficient ( C5D ) human serum , particularly sera obtained from two C5D homozygotes . The proband , who has inactive systemic lupus erythematosus is completely lacking C5 , while her healthy half-sister has 1-2 % of normal levels . Both sera were severely impaired in their ability to generate chemotactic activity for normal human neutrophils upon incubation with aggregated human gamma-globulin or Escherichia coli endotoxin . This function was fully restored in the siblings serum , and substantially improved in the probands serum , by addition of highly purified human C5 to normal serum concentrations . Sera from eight family members who were apparently heterozygous for C5 deficiency gave normal chemotactic scores . The ability of C5D serum to opsonize Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( bakers yeast ) or Candida albicans for ingestion by normal neutrophils was completely normal . In addition , C5D serum was capable of promoting normal phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus . The probands serum was incapable of mediating lysis of erythrocytes from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in both the sucrose hemolysia and acid hemolysis tests , and also lacked bactericidal activity against sensitized or unsensitized Salmonella typhi . The siblings serum , containing only 1-2 % of normal C5 , effectively lysed S . typhi , but only at eightfold lower serum dilutions as compared to normals . These findings underscore the critical role of C5 in the generation of chemotactic activity and in cytolytic reactions , as opposed to a nonobligatory or minimal role in opsonization , at least for the organisms under study . .;neurological;['neurological']

Germline mutations in the 3' part of APC exon 15 do not result in truncated proteins and are associated with attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli.;Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps predominantly in the colorectal region . Germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene are responsible for most cases of FAP . Mutations at the 5 end of APC are known to be associated with a relatively mild form of the disease , called attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( AAPC ) . We identified a frameshift mutation in the 3 part of exon 15 , resulting in a stop codon at 1862 , in a large Dutch kindred with AAPC . Western blot analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from affected family members from this kindred , as well as from a previously reported Swiss family carrying a frameshift mutation at codon 1987 and displaying a similar attenuated phenotype , showed only the wild-type APC protein . Our study indicates that chain-terminating mutations located in the 3 part of APC do not result in detectable truncated polypeptides and we hypothesize that this is likely to be the basis for the observed AAPC phenotype . .;oncological;['oncological']

Hallucinations and ifosfamide-induced neurotoxicity.;"BACKGROUND: Hallucinations as a symptom of central neurotoxicity are a known but poorly described side effect of ifosfamide. Most cases of ifosfamide-induced hallucinations have been reported with other mental status changes. METHODS: The authors interviewed six persons with ifosfamide-induced hallucinations in the presence of a clear sensorium. All patients were receiving high-dose ifosfamide as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure. RESULTS: Hallucinations occurred only when the patient's eyes were closed and, in all but one case, were reported as disturbing or frightening. Underreporting of these hallucinations by patients is likely. CONCLUSIONS: Hallucinations may be the sole or first manifestation of neurotoxicity. The incidence may be dose and infusion-time related. The clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide-induced hallucinations, which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity. ""Eyes-closed"" hallucinatory experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation. Patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence. Optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear. If agitation becomes marked, high-potency neuroleptics (i.e., haloperidol) may be effective.";neurological;['neurological']

Remodelling of nerve structure in experimental isoniazid neuropathy in the rat.;The neuropathy caused by a single dose of isoniazid in rats was studied with a computer-assisted morphometric method. Scatter diagrams of the g ratio (quotient fibre diameter/axon diameter) define regenerating fibres as a distinct population, distinguishable from the surviving fibres by reduced sheath thickness and reduced axon calibre. There was also evidence of a subtle direct toxic effect on the entire fibre population, causing axon shrinkage masked by readjustment of the myelin sheath.;neurological;['neurological']
Serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine-induced psychosis in a Japanese population.;BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. The serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis. METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. Moreover, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced psychosis patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced psychosis in the Japanese population.;neurological;['neurological']

Down-regulation of norepinephrine transporter function induced by chronic administration of desipramine linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local-anesthetics-induced convulsions and the counteraction by co-administration with local anesthetics.;Alterations of norepinephrine transporter (NET) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to seizures induce by cocaine and local anesthetics were studied in mice. Daily administration of desipramine, an inhibitor of the NET, for 5 days decreased [(3)H]norepinephrine uptake in the P2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex, striatum or amygdalae. Co-administration of lidocaine, bupivacaine or tricaine with desipramine reversed this effect. Daily treatment of cocaine increased [(3)H]norepinephrine uptake into the hippocampus. Daily administration of desipramine increased the incidence of appearance of lidocaine-induced convulsions and decreased that of cocaine-induced convulsions. Co-administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desipramine. These results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine convulsions. Inhibition of Na(+) channels by local anesthetics may regulate desipramine-induced down-regulation of NET function. Repeated administration of cocaine induces up-regulation of hippocampal NET function. Desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine seizures may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of cocaine.;neurological;['neurological']
Water intoxication associated with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortion.;Four cases of water intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortions are described. The mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cases. Oxytocin administration during midtrimester-induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of water intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia, muscular irritability, or headaches. The oxytocin should be given only in Ringers lactate or, alternately, in Ringers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solutions. The urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases. The oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hours. If the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance.;neurological;['neurological']

Hormones and risk of breast cancer.;"This paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy. The majority (29) had surgical menopause; their mean age was 45.7 years. It was hypothesized that progestins could equilibrate the effects of the estrogenic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therapy. The treatment schedule consisted of conjugated estrogens (Premarin) 1.25 mg/day for 21 days and Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 10 days in each month. The mean treatment period was 18 months. During the follow-up period, attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology, physical examination, and plate thermography. Mastodynia was reported by 21 patients, and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women. Themography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate mastodynia and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe mastodynia. Normalization was obtained by halving the estrogen dose. These results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied: 1) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical, metabolic, cytologic, and mammographic perspective; 2) cyclic treatment schedule, with a progestative phase of 10 days; and 3) periodic complete follow-up, with accurate thermographic evaluation of the breast target tissues.";oncological;['oncological']
Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on lithium-induced chronic renal failure in rats.;Rats with lithium-induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein (HP) feeding, uninephrectomy (NX) or a combination of these, in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure. Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium-containing diet (50 mmol/kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, HP diet (40 vs. 19%), NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks. Corresponding non-lithium pretreated groups were generated. When comparing all lithium treated versus non-lithium-treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance. Consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion. Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis. HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats. NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP. NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li-pretreated rats. The results indicate that Li-induced nephropathy, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension. In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli. The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced, leaving the distal delivery unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']

Cardiac Na(+) channel dysfunction in Brugada syndrome is aggravated by beta(1)-subunit.;"BACKGROUND  Mutations in the gene encoding the human cardiac Na ( + ) channel alpha-subunit ( hH1 ) are responsible for chromosome 3-linked congenital long-QT syndrome ( LQT3 ) and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation ( IVF ) . An auxiliary beta ( 1 ) -subunit , widely expressed in excitable tissues , shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation toward more negative potentials and restores normal gating kinetics of brain and skeletal muscle Na ( + ) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes but has little if any functional effect on the cardiac isoform . Here , we characterize the altered effects of a human beta ( 1 ) -subunit ( hbeta ( 1 ) ) on the heterologously expressed hH1 mutation ( T1620M ) previously associated with IVF . METHODS AND RESULTS  When expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes , T1620M exhibited no persistent currents , in contrast to the LQT3 mutant channels , but the midpoint of steady-state inactivation ( V ( 1 / 2 ) ) was significantly shifted toward more positive potentials than for wild-type hH1 . Coexpression of hbeta ( 1 ) did not significantly alter current decay or recovery from inactivation of wild-type hH1 ; however , it further shifted the V ( 1 / 2 ) and accelerated the recovery from inactivation of T1620M . Oocyte macropatch analysis revealed that the activation kinetics of T1620M were normal . CONCLUSIONS  It is suggested that coexpression of hbeta ( 1 ) exposes a more severe functional defect that results in a greater overlap in the relationship between channel inactivation and activation ( window current ) in T1620M , which is proposed to be a potential pathophysiological mechanism of IVF in vivo . One possible explanation for our finding is an altered alpha- / beta ( 1 ) -subunit association in the mutant . .";neurological;['neurological']

Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy.;The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian 'off' signs and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests (Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in LID. We also found a highly significant correlation (P: < 0.0001, r = 0.8) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in LID in the contralateral limbs, whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian 'off' signs. The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian 'off' signs. The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian 'off' signs and LID and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian 'off' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian 'off' signs and dyskinesias. Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in parkinsonism, the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of LID. We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy. The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms, and hence could be variable.;neurological;['neurological']
HLA B27 and the genetics of ankylosing spondylitis.;One hundred and twenty-eight of 145 patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) were found to be HLA B27 positive . Five patients had evidence of a sero-negative peripheral arthritis resembling peripheral psoriatic arthritis and 3 of these were B27 negative . One further B27 negative patients had a sister with ankylosing spondylitis and ulcerative colitis and a mother with ulcerative colitis . There was evidence of a somewhat later age of onset of symptoms in B27 negative patients . These findings are interpreted as suggesting some degree of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in ankylosing spondylitis with genes for psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease being important in some individuals , particularly those who are B27 negative . Twenty-five first-degree relatives with ankylosing spondylitis were all B27 positive . The only instance of disassociation of B27 and spondylitis in a family was where the proband had ulcerative colitis as well as spondylitis . Of 13 B27 positive fathers 3 could be diagnosed as having definite ankylosing spondylitis ( 23 % ) . These findings are thought to provide evidence against the concept that the gene for ankylosing spondylitis is not B27 but a closely linked gene and favour the occurrence of an environmental event affecting approximately one-fifth of B27 positive males to result in disease . .;neurological;['neurological']
Treatment of ovarian cancer with a combination of cis-platinum, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and hexamethylmelamine.;"During the last 2 1/2 years, 38 patients with ovarian cancer were treated with a combination of cisplatinum (CPDD), 50 mg/m2, adriamycin, 30 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2, on day 1; and hexamethylmelamine (HMM), 6 mg/kg daily, for 14 days.

Mitral annuloplasty as a ventricular restoration method for the failing left ventricle: a pilot study.;"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Undersized mitral annuloplasty (MAP) is effective in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and functional mitral regurgitation (MR) since, as well as addressing the MR, the MAP may also reshape the dilated left ventricular (LV) base. However, the direct benefits of this possible reshaping on LV function in the absence of underlying MR remain incompletely understood. The study aim was to identify these benefits in a canine model of acute heart failure. METHODS: Six dogs underwent MAP with a prosthetic band on the posterior mitral annulus, using four mattress sutures. The sutures were passed individually through four tourniquets and exteriorized untied via the left atriotomy. Sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around the mitral annulus and left ventricle to measure geometry and regional function. Acute heart failure was induced by propranolol and volume loading after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass; an absence of MR was confirmed by echocardiography. MAP was accomplished by cinching the tourniquets. Data were acquired at baseline, after induction of acute heart failure, and after MAP. RESULTS: MAP decreased mitral annular dimensions in both commissure-commissure and septal-lateral directions. Concomitantly, the diastolic diameter of the LV base and LV sphericity decreased (i.e., improved) from 37.4 +/- 9.3 to 35.9 +/- 10 mm (p = 0.063), and from 67.9 +/- 18.6% to 65.3 +/- 18.9% (p = 0.016), respectively. Decreases were evident in both LV end-diastolic pressure (from 17 +/- 7 to 15 +/- 6 mmHg, p = 0.0480 and Tau (from 48 +/- 8 to 45 +/- 8 ms, p <0.01), while fractional shortening at the LV base increased from 7.7 +/- 4.5% to 9.4 +/- 4.5% (p = 0.045). After MAP, increases were identified in both cardiac output (from 1.54 +/- 0.57 to 1.65 +/- 0.57 1/min) and Emax (from 1.86 +/- 0.9 to 2.41 +/- 1.31 mmHg/ml). CONCLUSION: The data acquired suggest that isolated MAP may have certain benefits on LV dimension/function in acute heart failure, even in the absence of MR. However, further investigations are warranted in a model of chronic heart failure.";neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']
Associations between use of benzodiazepines or related drugs and health, physical abilities and cognitive function: a non-randomised clinical study in the elderly.;OBJECTIVE: To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs (BZDs/RDs) and health, functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly. METHODS: A non-randomised clinical study of patients aged > or =65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month. 164 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 81.6 +/- 6.8 years) were admitted. Of these, nearly half (n = 78) had used BZDs/RDs before admission, and the remainder (n = 86) were non-users. Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients scoring > or =20 MMSE sum points were interviewed (n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission. Data on use of BZDs/RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records. Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD/RD users and non-users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables. The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone were analysed. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of BZD/RD use was 7 +/- 7 years (range 1-31). Two or three BZDs/RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users (n = 20). Long-term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia. After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of BZDs/RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE. However, use of BZDs/RDs was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay. Use of BZDs/RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission. A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD/RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses. Long-term use was associated with daytime and night-time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs.;neurological;['neurological']

Ventricular fibrillation from diatrizoate with and without chelating agents.;The toxicity of Renografin 76% was compared with that of Hypaque 76% by selective injection of each into the right coronary artery of dogs. Renografin contains the chelating agents sodium citrate and disodium edetate, while Hypaque contains calcium disodium edetate and no sodium citrate. Ventricular fibrillation occurred significantly more often with Renografin, suggesting that chelating agents contribute to toxicity in coronary angiography.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']
The gene for spinal cerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) is located in a region of approximately 3 cM on chromosome 14q24.;3-q32.2. SCA3 , the gene for spinal cerebellar ataxia 3 , was recently mapped to a 15-cM interval between D14S67 and D14S81 on chromosome 14q , by linkage analysis in two families of French ancestry . The SCA3 candidate region has now been refined by linkage analysis with four new microsatellite markers ( D14S256 , D14S291 , D14S280 , and AFM343vf1 ) in the same two families , in which 19 additional individuals were genotyped , and in a third French family . Combined two-point linkage analyses show that the new markers , D14S280 and AFM343vf1 , are tightly linked to the SCA3 locus , with maximal lod scores , at recombination fraction , ( theta ) = . 00 , of 7 . 05 and 13 . 70 , respectively . Combined multipoint and recombinant haplotype analyses localize the SCA3 locus to a 3-cM interval flanked by D14S291 and D14S81 . The same allele for D14S280 segregates with the disease locus in the three kindreds . This allele is frequent in the French population , however , and linkage disequilibrium is not clearly established . The SCA3 locus remains within the 29-cM region on 14q24 . 3-q32 . 2 containing the gene for the Machado-Joseph disease , which is clinically related to the phenotype determined by SCA3 , but it cannot yet be concluded that both diseases result from alterations of the same gene;neurological;['neurological']
Hypertension in neuroblastoma induced by imipramine.;Hypertension is a well-known finding in some patients with neuroblastoma. However, it has not previously been described in association with the use of Imipramine. We report the occurrence of severe hypertension (blood pressure 190/160) in a 4-year-old girl with neuroblastoma who was given Imipramine to control a behavior disorder. It was determined later that this patient's tumor was recurring at the time of her hypertensive episode. Since she had no blood pressure elevation at initial diagnosis and none following discontinuation of the Imipramine (when she was in florid relapse), we believe that this drug rather than her underlying disease alone caused her hypertension. The mechanism for this reaction is believed to be increased levels of vasoactive catecholamines due to interference of their physiologic inactivation by Imipramine. From this experience, we urge extreme caution in the use of tricyclic antidepressants in children with active neuroblastoma.;neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;['neurological', 'cardiovascular', 'oncological']

Comparison of developmental toxicity of selective and non-selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in CRL:(WI)WUBR Wistar rats--DFU and piroxicam study.;"BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy. Unlike general toxicity data, their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non-selective (piroxicam) and selective (DFU; 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) phenyl-2(5H)-furanon) COX-2 inhibitors. METHODS: Drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 (GD1=plug day). Doses were set at 0.3, 3.0 and 30.0mg/kg for piroxicam and 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0mg/kg for DFU. Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined. Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done. The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal (VSD) and midline (MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam, selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor based on present and historic data. RESULTS: Maternal toxicity, intrauterine growth retardation, and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam. Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose. Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU-exposed groups. Prenatal exposure to non-selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX-2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Both selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose. Unlike DFU, piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams. Prenatal exposure to selective COX-2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non-selective drugs and historic control.";neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']
Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.;"BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms. It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, heart disease, venous thromboembolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gallbladder disease, cognitive function, dementia, fractures and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases up to November 2004: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT (oestrogens with or without progestogens) versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Fifteen RCTs were included. Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently. They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after 3 years), breast cancer (after 5 years) and gallbladder disease. Long-term oestrogen-only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease. Overall, the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long-term use. Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism. No trials focussed specifically on younger women. However, one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year-old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT; their absolute risk remained very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.";neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;['neurological', 'cardiovascular', 'oncological']
Long-term prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver failure.;BACKGROUND: The prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver failure remains unknown. AIM: To examine whether paracetamol-induced acute liver failure increases long-term mortality. METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. We compared age-specific mortality rates from 1 year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not. RESULTS: We included 641 patients. On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol-induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups. These observations speak against long-term effects of acute liver failure. More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol-induced acute liver failure did not affect long-term mortality. Clinical follow-up may be justified by the cause of the liver failure, but not by the liver failure itself.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

The gene for familial Mediterranean fever, MEFV, is expressed in early leukocyte development and is regulated in response to inflammatory mediators.;Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever and neutrophil-mediated serosal inflammation . We recently identified the gene causing FMF , designated MEFV , and found it to be expressed in mature neutrophils , suggesting that it functions as an inflammatory regulator . To facilitate our understanding of the normal function of MEFV , we extended our previous studies . MEFV messenger RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow leukocytes , with differential expression observed among cells by in situ hybridization . CD34 hematopoietic stem-cell cultures induced toward the granulocytic lineage expressed MEFV at the myelocyte stage , concurrently with lineage commitment . The prepromyelocytic cell line HL60 expressed MEFV only at granulocytic and monocytic differentiation . MEFV was also expressed in the monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1 . Among peripheral blood leukocytes , MEFV expression was detected in neutrophils , eosinophils , and to varying degrees , monocytes . Consistent with the tissue specificity of expression , complete sequencing and analysis of upstream regulatory regions of MEFV revealed homology to myeloid-specific promoters and to more broadly expressed inflammatory promoter elements . In vitro stimulation of monocytes with the proinflammatory agents interferon ( IFN ) gamma , tumor necrosis factor , and lipopolysaccharide induced MEFV expression , whereas the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin ( IL ) 4 , IL-10 , and transforming growth factor beta inhibited such expression . Induction by IFN-gamma occurred rapidly and was resistant to cycloheximide . IFN-alpha also induced MEFV expression . In granulocytes , MEFV was up-regulated by IFN-gamma and the combination of IFN-alpha and colchicine . These results refine understanding of MEFV by placing the gene in the myelomonocytic-specific proinflammatory pathway and identifying it as an IFN-gamma immediate early gene . .;oncological;['oncological']
The attenuating effect of carteolol hydrochloride, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy in rats.;It is known that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of akathisia, one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment. Neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, a model of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects, was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic-induced akathisia in humans, although neuroleptic-induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Therefore, the effects of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Carteolol, as well as propranolol and biperiden, inhibited the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol, but was weaker than that of biperiden. Carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats. Carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine-induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats. In addition, carteolol did not evoke 5-HT1A receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitch in rats. Finally, carteolol did not inhibit physostigmine-induced lethality in rats. These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol-induced catalepsy via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia without attenuating neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity.;neurological;['neurological']

22-oxacalcitriol suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with renal failure.;"BACKGROUND: Calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with renal failure but has several drawbacks, including hypercalcemia and/or marked suppression of bone turnover, which may lead to adynamic bone disease. A new vitamin D analogue, 22-oxacalcitriol (OCT), has been shown to have promising characteristics. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of OCT on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function. METHODS: Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized (Nx, N = 38) or sham-operated (Sham, N = 22). The animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance PTH secretion. Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of OCT (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks. Thereafter, the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months. Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after OCT or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period. RESULTS: In Nx dogs, OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency. In long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, OCT (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months. Serum PTH levels rose thereafter, but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control. These effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. In animals with normal renal function, OCT induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0.1 microg/kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses. In Nx dogs, OCT reversed abnormal bone formation, such as woven osteoid and fibrosis, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover. In addition, OCT improved mineralization lag time, (that is, the rate at which osteoid mineralizes) in both Nx and Sham dogs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though OCT does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency, it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and, therefore, does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease.";hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']
Cauda equina syndrome after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5% lignocaine: a review of six cases of cauda equina syndrome reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993-1997.;Six cases of cauda equina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993-1997. All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% lignocaine. Five cases had single-shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block. The dose of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg. Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine. In the other 3 cases, direct neurotoxicity was also probable, but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology. All cases sustained permanent neurological deficits. We recommend that hyperbaric lignocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2% and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg.;neurological;['neurological']

Cocaine-induced brainstem seizures and behavior.;"A variety of abnormal sensory/motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical (electrode implants) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine. The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations. Cocaine (40 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg/kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study. Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group, especially the electrically perturbated subjects. The abnormal behaviors were yawning, retrocollis, hyperactivity, hypersensitivity, ""beating drum"" behavior, squealing, head bobbing, circling, sniffing, abnormal posturing, and facial twitching. Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states. Hypersensitivity to various auditory, tactile, and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation. These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation. Cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates. Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated.";neurological;['neurological']

Rhabdomyolysis and brain ischemic stroke in a heroin-dependent male under methadone maintenance therapy.;OBJECTIVE: There are several complications associated with heroin abuse, some of which are life-threatening. Methadone may aggravate this problem. METHOD: A clinical case description. RESULTS: A 33-year-old man presented with rhabdomyolysis and cerebral ischemic stroke after intravenous heroin. He had used heroin since age 20, and had used 150 mg methadone daily for 6 months. He was found unconsciousness at home and was sent to our hospital. In the ER, his opiate level was 4497 ng/ml. In the ICU, we found rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and acute respiratory failure. After transfer to an internal ward, we noted aphasia and weakness of his left limbs. After MRI, we found cerebral ischemic infarction. CONCLUSION: Those using methadone and heroin simultaneously may increase risk of rhabdomyolysis and ischemic stroke. Patients under methadone maintenance therapy should be warned regarding these serious adverse events.

Detection of eight BRCA1 mutations in 10 breast/ovarian cancer families, including 1 family with male breast cancer.;Genetic epidemiological evidence suggests that mutations in BRCA1 may be responsible for approximately one half of early onset familial breast cancer and the majority of familial breast / ovarian cancer . The recent cloning of BRCA1 allows for the direct detection of mutations , but the feasibility of presymptomatic screening for cancer susceptibility is unknown . We analyzed genomic DNA from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or breast cancer , using SSCP assays . Variant SSCP bands were subcloned and sequenced . Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen DNA from control individuals . Six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families . A frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and prostate cancer . A 40-bp deletion was detected in a patient who developed intra-abdominal carcinomatosis 1 year after prophylactic oophorectomy . Mutations were detected throughout the gene , and only one was detected in more than a single family . These results provide further evidence that inherited breast and ovarian cancer can occur as a consequence of a wide array of BRCA1 mutations . These results suggests that development of a screening test for BRCA1 mutations will be technically challenging . The finding of a mutation in a family with male breast cancer , not previously thought to be related to BRCA1 , also illustrates the potential difficulties of genetic counseling for individuals known to carry mutations . .;oncological;['oncological']

Phase II trial of vinorelbine in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gastrointestinal Treat Cancer Cooperative Group.;"PURPOSE: To evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of vinorelbine (VNB) administered as a single agent in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy. Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response. VNB was administered weekly as a 25-mg/m2 short intravenous (i.v.) infusion. RESULTS: Six of 30 patients (20%) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response (PR) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8% to 39%). The median duration of response was 21 weeks (range, 17 to 28). One of 16 patients (6%) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response (CR) of 31 weeks' duration (95% CI, 0% to 30%). The overall response rate (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) was 15% (CR, 2%; PR 13%; 95% CI, 6% to 29%). The median dose-intensity (DI) was 20 mg/m2/wk. VNB was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred. At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 59% of patients. A grade 2 or 3 infection occurred in 16% of patients, but no toxic deaths occurred. Other side effects were rare, and peripheral neurotoxicity has been minor (26% grade 1). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that VNB is an active agent in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Given its excellent tolerance profile and low toxicity, further evaluation of VNB in combination therapy is warranted.";neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']

Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells.;"Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) , the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults , is caused by ( CTG ) n-repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase ( DM protein kinase ; DMPK ) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis . To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis , we have compared the resting [ Ca2 + ] i , the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced Ca2 + transients , and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild-type and DMPK [ - / - ] knockout mice . In vitro-differentiated DMPK [ - / - ] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [ Ca2 + ] i than do wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2 + and Na + channels . The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K + . In addition , we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l-type Ca2 + channel . Neither the content nor the activity of Na + / K + ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase are affected by DMPK absence . In conclusion , our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle . .";neurological;['neurological']
A comparison of glyceryl trinitrate with diclofenac for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea: an open, randomized, cross-over trial.;"Primary dysmenorrhea is a syndrome characterized by painful uterine contractility caused by a hypersecretion of endometrial prostaglandins; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first choice for its treatment. However, in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that myometrial cells are also targets of the relaxant effects of nitric oxide (NO). The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), an NO donor, in the resolution of primary dysmenorrhea in comparison with diclofenac (DCF). A total of 24 patients with the diagnosis of severe primary dysmenorrhea were studied during two consecutive menstrual cycles. In an open, cross-over, controlled design, patients were randomized to receive either DCF per os or GTN patches the first days of menses, when menstrual cramps became unendurable. In the subsequent cycle the other treatment was used. Patients received up to 3 doses/day of 50 mg DCF or 2.5 mg/24 h transdermal GTN for the first 3 days of the cycle, according to their needs. The participants recorded menstrual symptoms and possible side-effects at different times (0, 30, 60, 120 minutes) after the first dose of medication on the first day of the cycle, with both drugs. The difference in pain intensity score (DPI) was the main outcome variable. Both treatments significantly reduced DPI by the 30th minute (GTN, -12.8 +/- 17.9; DCF, -18.9 +/- 16.6). However, DCF continued to be effective in reducing pelvic pain for two hours, whereas GTN scores remained more or less stable after 30 min and significantly higher than those for DFC (after one hour: GTN, -12.8 +/- 17.9; DFC, -18.9 +/- 16.6 and after two hours: GTN, -23.7 +/- 20.5; DFC, -59.7 +/- 17.9, p = 0.0001). Low back pain was also relieved by both drugs. Headache was significantly increased by GTN but not by DCF. Eight patients stopped using GTN because headache--attributed to its use--became intolerable. These findings indicate that GTN has a reduced efficacy and tolerability by comparison with DCF in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.";neurological;['neurological']

Hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone and amiodarone in animals with a healed myocardial infarction.;The hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone, a noniodinated compound structurally related to amiodarone, were compared with those of amiodarone after prolonged oral administration, both at rest and during sympathetic stimulation in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction. All dogs (n = 6) randomly received orally dronedarone (10 and 30 mg/kg), amiodarone (10 and 30 mg/kg), and placebo twice daily for 7 days, with a 3-week washout between consecutive treatments. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MBP), positive rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (+LVdP/dt), echocardiographically assessed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and fractional shortening (FS), as well as chronotropic response to isoproterenol and exercise-induced sympathetic stimulation were evaluated under baseline and posttreatment conditions. Resting values of LVEF, FS, +LVdP/dt, and MBP remained unchanged whatever the drug and the dosing regimen, whereas resting HR was significantly and dose-dependently lowered after dronedarone and to a lesser extent after amiodarone. Both dronedarone and amiodarone significantly reduced the exercise-induced tachycardia and, at the highest dose, decreased the isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Thus, dronedarone and amiodarone displayed a similar level of antiadrenergic effect and did not impair the resting left ventricular function. Consequently, dronedarone might be particularly suitable for the treatment and prevention of various clinical arrhythmias, without compromising the left ventricular function.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']

Inherited WT1 mutation in Denys-Drash syndrome.;Patients with the Denys-Drash syndrome ( Wilms tumor , genital anomalies , and nephropathy ) have been demonstrated to carry de novo constitutional mutations in WT1 , the Wilms tumor gene at chromosome 11p13 . We report three new cases , two carrying a previously described WT1 exon 9 mutation and one with a novel WT1 exon 8 mutation . However , unlike patients in previous reports , one of our three patients inherited the affected allele from his phenotypically unaffected father . This observation indicates that the WT1 exon 9 mutation affecting 394Arg demonstrated in over one-half of the patients with the Denys-Drash syndrome may exhibit incomplete penetrance . Consequently , familial studies in patients affected by this syndrome are recommended . .;neurological|hepatorenal|oncological;['neurological', 'hepatorenal', 'oncological']
Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose.;"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas/Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure. The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure. METHODOLOGY: Serum levels of sFas (soluble Fas) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma were also determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure (median, 26.8 U/mL; range, 6.9-52.7 U/mL) compared to the normal controls (median, 8.6 U/mL; range, 6.5-12.0 U/mL, P < 0.0001). Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose (median, 28.7 U/mL; range, 12.8-52.7 U/mL, n = 17) than those due to non-A to E hepatitis (median, 12.5 U/mL; range, 6.9-46.0 U/mL, n = 7, P < 0.01). There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients. A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.613, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss.";neurological|hepatorenal|oncological;['neurological', 'hepatorenal', 'oncological']

Acute renal failure occurring during intravenous desferrioxamine therapy: recovery after haemodialysis.;A patient with transfusion-dependent thalassemia was undergoing home intravenous desferrioxamine (DFX) treatment by means of a totally implanted system because of his poor compliance with the nightly subcutaneous therapy. Due to an accidental malfunctioning of the infusion pump, the patient was inadvertently administered a toxic dosage of the drug which caused renal insufficiency. Given the progressive deterioration of the symptoms and of the laboratory values, despite adequate medical treatment, a decision was made to introduce haemodialytical therapy in order to remove the drug and therapy reduce the nephrotoxicity. From the results obtained, haemodialysis can therefore be suggested as a useful therapy in rare cases of progressive acute renal failure caused by desferrioxamine.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']
Novel inherited mutations and variable expressivity of BRCA1 alleles, including the founder mutation 185delAG in Ashkenazi Jewish families.;Thirty-seven families with four or more cases of breast cancer or breast and ovarian cancer were analyzed for mutations in BRCA1 . Twelve different germ-line mutations , four novel and eight previously observed , were detected in 16 families . Five families of Ashkenazi Jewish descent carried the 185delAG mutation and shared the same haplotype at eight polymorphic markers spanning approximately 850 kb at BRCA1 . Expressivity of 185delAG in these families varied , from early-onset breast cancer without ovarian cancer . Mutation 4184delTCAA occurred independently in two families . In one family , penetrance was complete , with females developing early-onset breast cancer or ovarian cancer and the male carrier developing prostatic cancer , whereas , in the other family , penetrance was incomplete and only breast cancer occurred , diagnosed at ages 38-81 years . Two novel nonsense mutations led to the loss of mutant BRCA1 transcript in families with 10 and 6 cases of early-onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer . A 665-nt segment of the BRCA1 3-UTR and 1 . 3 kb of genomic sequence including the putative promoter region were invariant by single-strand conformation analysis in 13 families without coding-sequence mutations . Overall in our series , BRCA1 mutations have been detected in 26 families  16 with positive BRCA1 lod scores , 7 with negative lod scores ( reflecting multiple sporadic breast cancers ) , and 3 not tested for linkage . Three other families have positive lod scores for linkage to BRCA2 , but 13 families without detected BRCA1 mutations have negative lod scores for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 .;oncological;['oncological']

"Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 2 and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome: a case for ""lumping"".";Recent studies demonstrated the existence of a genetically distinct , usually lethal form of the Schwartz-Jampel syndrome ( SJS ) of myotonia and skeletal dysplasia , which we called SJS type 2 . This disorder is reminiscent of another rare condition , the Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome ( SWS ) , which comprises campomelia at birth with skeletal dysplasia , contractures , and early death . To test for possible nosologic identity between these disorders , we reviewed the literature and obtained a follow-up of the only two surviving patients , one with SJS type 2 at age 10 years and another with SWS at age 7 years . Patients reported as having either neonatal SJS or SWS presented a combination of a severe , prenatal-onset neuromuscular disorder ( with congenital joint contractures , respiratory and feeding difficulties , tendency to hyperthermia , and frequent death in infancy ) with a distinct campomelic-metaphyseal skeletal dysplasia . The similarity of the clinical and radiographic findings is so extensive that these disorders appear to be a single entity . The follow-up observation of an identical and unique pattern of progressive bone dysplasia in the two patients ( one with SJS type 2 , one with SWS ) surviving beyond infancy adds to the evidence in favor of identity . The hypothesis that SWS and SJS type 2 are the same disorder should be testable by molecular methods . .;neurological;['neurological']
A novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the BBB.;The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound. A Tween 80-coated poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the BBB. Tacrine, administered in LiCl pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage. The toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a saline solution of tacrine (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in LiCl-pre-treated Wistar rats. All the animals treated with tacrine-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively). In addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals. Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals. In conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine-lithium model of epilepsy in the rat, could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the BBB in vivo.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']
Adrenoleukodystrophy: survey of 303 cases: biochemistry, diagnosis, and therapy.;Adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) is a genetically determined disorder associated with progressive central demyelination and adrenal cortical insufficiency . All affected persons show increased levels of saturated unbranched very-long-chain fatty acids , particularly hexacosanoate ( C26  0 ) , because of impaired capacity to degrade these acids . This degradation normally takes place in a subcellular organelle called the peroxisome , and ALD , together with Zellwegers cerebrohepatorenal syndrome , is now considered to belong to the newly formed category of peroxisomal disorders . Biochemical assays permit prenatal diagnosis , as well as identification of most heterozygotes . We have identified 303 patients with ALD in 217 kindreds . These patients show a wide phenotypic variation . Sixty percent of patients had childhood ALD and 17 % adrenomyeloneuropathy , both of which are X-linked , with the gene mapped to Xq28 . Neonatal ALD , a distinct entity with autosomal recessive inheritance and points of resemblance to Zellwegers syndrome , accounted for 7 % of the cases . Although excess C26  0 in the brain of patients with ALD is partially of dietary origin , dietary C26  0 restriction did not produce clear benefit . Bone marrow transplant lowered the plasma C26  0 level but failed to arrest neurological progression . .;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']
Clustering of missense mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia gene in a sporadic T-cell leukaemia.;Ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) is a recessive multi-system disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene at 11q22-q23 ( ref . 3 ) . The risk of cancer , especially lymphoid neoplasias , is substantially elevated in A-T patients and has long been associated with chromosomal instability . By analysing tumour DNA from patients with sporadic T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( T-PLL ) , a rare clonal malignancy with similarities to a mature T-cell leukaemia seen in A-T , we demonstrate a high frequency of ATM mutations in T-PLL . In marked contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in A-T , the most frequent nucleotide changes in this leukaemia were missense mutations . These clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain , which is highly conserved in ATM-related proteins in mouse , yeast and Drosophila . The resulting amino-acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with ATP binding or substrate recognition . Two of seventeen mutated T-PLL samples had a previously reported A-T allele . In contrast , no mutations were detected in the p53 gene , suggesting that this tumour suppressor is not frequently altered in this leukaemia . Occasional missense mutations in ATM were also found in tumour DNA from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas ( B-NHL ) and a B-NHL cell line . The evidence of a significant proportion of loss-of-function mutations and a complete absence of the normal copy of ATM in the majority of mutated tumours establishes somatic inactivation of this gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic T-PLL and suggests that ATM acts as a tumour suppressor . As constitutional DNA was not available , a putative hereditary predisposition to T-PLL will require further investigation . .;neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']
Efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin in 3390 women with moderate hypercholesterolemia.;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in women with moderate hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN: The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. SETTING: Ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the United States. PATIENTS: Women (n = 3390) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study. RESULTS: Among women, lovastatin (20 to 80 mg/d) produced sustained (12- to 48-week), dose-related changes (P < 0.001): decreases in LDL cholesterol (24% to 40%) and triglycerides (9% to 18%), and increases in HDL cholesterol (6.7% to 8.6%). Depending on the dose, from 82% to 95% of lovastatin-treated women achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program goal of LDL cholesterol levels less than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL), and 40% to 87% achieved the goal of 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). Successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.1% of women and were dose dependent above the 20-mg dose. Myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with creatine kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of lovastatin (80 mg). Estrogen-replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of lovastatin. CONCLUSION: Lovastatin is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary hypercholesterolemia in women.";neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

GEM-P chemotherapy is active in the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.;"Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a relatively chemosensitive malignancy. However, for those who relapse, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant is the treatment of choice which relies on adequate disease control with salvage chemotherapy. Regimens commonly used often require inpatient administration and can be difficult to deliver due to toxicity. Gemcitabine and cisplatin have activity in HL, non-overlapping toxicity with first-line chemotherapeutics, and may be delivered in an outpatient setting. In this retrospective single-centre analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory HL treated with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) day (D)1, D8 and D15; methylprednisolone 1,000 mg D1-5; and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) D15, every 28 days (GEM-P) were included. Demographic, survival, response and toxicity data were recorded. Forty-one eligible patients were identified: median age 27. One hundred and twenty-two cycles of GEM-P were administered in total (median 3 cycles; range 1-6). Twenty of 41 (48 %) patients received GEM-P as second-line treatment and 11/41 (27 %) as third-line therapy. Overall response rate (ORR) to GEM-P in the entire cohort was 80 % (complete response (CR) 37 %, partial response 44 %) with 14/15 CR confirmed as a metabolic CR on PET and ORR of 85 % in the 20 second-line patients. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were haematological: neutropenia 54 % and thrombocytopenia 51 %. Median follow-up from the start of GEM-P was 4.5 years. Following GEM-P, 5-year progression-free survival was 46 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 30-62 %) and 5-year overall survival was 59 % (95 % CI, 43-74 %). Fourteen of 41 patients proceeded directly to autologous transplant. GEM-P is a salvage chemotherapy with relatively high response rates, leading to successful transplantation in appropriate patients, in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL.";hepatorenal|oncological;['hepatorenal', 'oncological']

Ashkenazi Jewish population frequencies for common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.;BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major identified causes of inherited breast cancer , with mutations in either gene conferring up to 80-90 % lifetime risk of breast cancer in carrier females . Mutations in BRCA1 account for approximately 45 % of familial breast cancer and 90 % of inherited breast / ovarian cancer , whereas mutations in BRCA2 account for a comparable percentage of inherited breast cancer cases . Over 85 distinct BRCA1 mutations and a growing list of BRCA2 mutations have been identified , with the majority resulting in protein truncation . A specific BRCA1 mutation , 185delAG , has a reported increased carrier frequency of approximately 0 . 9 % in the Ashkenazi Jewish population , but is also found in rare non-Jewish patients with a different haplotype . The 6174delT mutation in BRCA2 was recently identified as a frequent mutation in 8 out of 107 Ashkenazi Jewish women diagnosed with breast cancer by age 50 ( ref . 8 ) , as well as in three Ashkenazi male breast cancer patients . We have conducted a large-scale population study to investigate the prevalence of specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who were unselected for breast cancer . BRCA1 mutation screening on approximately 3 , 000 Ashkenazi Jewish samples determined a carrier frequency of 1 . 09 % for the 185delAG mutation and 0 . 13 % for the 5382insC mutation . BRCA2 analysis on 3 , 085 individuals from the same population showed a carrier frequency of 1 . 52 % for the 6174delT mutation . This expanded population-based study confirms that the BRCA1 185delAG mutation and the BRCA2 6174delT mutation constitute the two most frequent mutation alleles predisposing to hereditary breast cancer among the Ashkenazim , and suggests a relatively lower penetrance for the 6174delT mutation in BRCA2;neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']
Cardiac toxicity observed in association with high-dose cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.;"INTRODUCTION: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens. In high doses, its nonhematological dose-limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy. STUDY DESIGN: We combined paclitaxel, melphalan and high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin in a triple sequential high-dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96-h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure (CHF) and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, age, hypertension, prior cardiac history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, prior use of anthracyclines, and left-sided chest irradiation. RESULTS: Six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%. Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide-related cardiac toxicity (10%) is comparable to previous recorded literature. Older age was significantly correlated with the CHF development; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing CHF of 45 and 59, respectively. No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of these findings, oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients. Routine EKG monitoring during infusional cyclophosphamide did not predict CHF development.";cardiovascular|oncological;['cardiovascular', 'oncological']

Influence of PAX6 gene dosage on development: overexpression causes severe eye abnormalities.;Aniridia in man and Small eye in mice are semidominant developmental disorders caused by mutations within the paired box gene PAX6 . Whereas heterozygotes suffer from iris hypoplasia , homozygous mice lack eyes and nasal cavities and exhibit brain abnormalities . To investigate the role of gene dosage in more detail , we have generated yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice carrying the human PAX6 locus . When crossed onto the Small eye background , the transgene rescues the mutant phenotype . Strikingly , mice carrying multiple copies on a wild-type background show specific developmental abnormalities of the eye , but not of other tissues expressing the gene . Thus , at least five different eye phenotypes are associated with changes in PAX6 expression .

In this study, we have utilized a rat model of progressive doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, applying multiple approaches, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide the most comprehensive characterization to date of the timecourse of serological, pathological, and functional events underlying this toxicity. Hannover Wistar rats were dosed with 1.25 mg/kg DOX weekly for 8 weeks followed by a 4 week off-dosing ""recovery"" period. Electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed subcellular degeneration and marked mitochondrial changes after a single dose. Histopathological analysis revealed progressive cardiomyocyte degeneration, hypertrophy/cytomegaly, and extensive vacuolation after two doses. Extensive replacement fibrosis (quantified by Sirius red staining) developed during the off-dosing period. Functional indices assessed by cardiac MRI (including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output, and E/A ratio) declined progressively, reaching statistical significance after two doses and culminating in ""clinical"" LV dysfunction by 12 weeks. Significant increases in peak myocardial contrast enhancement and serological cardiac troponin I (cTnI) emerged after eight doses, importantly preceding the LVEF decline to <50%. Troponin I levels positively correlated with delayed and peak gadolinium contrast enhancement, histopathological grading, and diastolic dysfunction. In summary, subcellular cardiomyocyte degeneration was the earliest marker, followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifestations. Myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in cTnI occurred later. However, all indices predated ""clinical"" LV dysfunction and thus warrant further evaluation as predictive biomarkers.";cardiovascular|oncological;['cardiovascular', 'oncological']
Combination of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD) as a consolidation therapy after autologous stem cell transplantation for symptomatic multiple myeloma in Japanese patients.;Consolidation therapy for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has been widely adopted to improve treatment response following autologous stem cell transplantation. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the safety and efficacy of combination regimen of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD) as consolidation therapy in 24 Japanese patients with newly diagnosed MM. VTD consisted of bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m(2) and dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 35-day cycle, with daily oral thalidomide at a dose of 100 mg/day. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were documented in four and three patients (17 and 13 %), respectively, but drug dose reduction due to cytopenia was not required in any case. Peripheral neuropathy was common (63 %), but severe grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy was not observed. Very good partial response or better response (>VGPR) rates before and after consolidation therapy were 54 and 79 %, respectively. Patients had a significant probability of improving from <VGPR before consolidation therapy to >VGPR after consolidation therapy (p = 0.041). The VTD regimen may be safe and effective as a consolidation therapy in the treatment of MM in Japanese population.;neurological;['neurological']

Reduced progression of adriamycin nephropathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated by losartan.;BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker, losartan, and its potential in slowing down renal disease progression in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy. METHODS: Six-month-old female SHR were randomly selected in six groups. Two control groups (SH(6), SH(12)) received vehicle. Groups ADR(6), ADR+LOS(6) and ADR(12), and ADR+LOS(12) received ADR (2 mg/kg/b.w. i.v.) twice in a 3-week interval. Group ADR+LOS(6) received losartan (10 mg/kg/b.w./day by gavages) for 6 weeks and group ADR+LOS(12) for 12 weeks after second injection of ADR. Animals were killed after 6 or 12 weeks, respectively. Haemodynamic measurements were performed on anaesthetized animals, blood and urine samples were taken for biochemical analysis and the left kidney was processed for morphological studies. RESULTS: Short-term losartan treatment, besides antihypertensive effect, improved glomerular filtration rate and ameliorated glomerulosclerosis resulting in decreased proteinuria. Prolonged treatment with losartan showed further reduction of glomerulosclerosis associated with reduced progression of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, thus preventing heavy proteinuria and chronic renal failure. Losartan reduced uraemia and increased urea clearance in advanced ADR nephropathy in SHR. Histological examination showed that losartan could prevent tubular atrophy, interstitial infiltration and fibrosis in ADR nephropathy. CONCLUSION: Losartan reduces the rate of progression of ADR-induced focal segmental glomerulosclerosis to end-stage renal disease in SHR.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']
Hepatocellular oxidant stress following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.;Reperfusion of ischemic intestine results in acute liver dysfunction characterized by hepatocellular enzyme release into plasma, reduction in bile flow rate, and neutrophil sequestration within the liver. The pathophysiology underlying this acute hepatic injury is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether oxidants are associated with the hepatic injury and to determine the relative value of several indirect methods of assessing oxidant exposure in vivo. Rats were subjected to a standardized intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hepatic tissue was assayed for lipid peroxidation products and oxidized and reduced glutathione. There was no change in hepatic tissue total glutathione following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) increased significantly following 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. There was no increase in any of the products of lipid peroxidation associated with this injury. An increase in GSSG within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion suggests exposure of hepatocytes to an oxidant stress. The lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to result in irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membranes. These data also suggest that the measurement of tissue GSSG may be a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress than measurement of products of lipid peroxidation.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Genomic rearrangements of the APC tumor-suppressor gene in familial adenomatous polyposis.;Germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumor-suppressor gene result in the hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . Almost all APC mutations that have been identified are single-nucleotide alterations , small insertions , or small deletions that would truncate the protein product of the gene . No well-characterized intragenic rearrangement of APC has been described , and the prevalence of this type of mutation in FAP patients is not clear . We screened 49 potential FAP families and identified 26 different germline APC mutations in 30 families . Four of these mutations were genomic rearrangements resulting from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by Alu elements . Two of these four rearrangements were complex , involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides . Of these four rearrangements , one resulted in the deletion of exons 11 and 12 and two others resulted in either complete or partial deletion of exon 14 . The fourth rearrangement grossly altered the sequence within intron 14 . Although this rearrangement did not affect any coding sequence of APC at the genomic DNA level , it caused inappropriate splicing of exon 14 . These rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cDNAs and could not have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened each exon individually . The identification of a rearrangement that did not alter any coding exons yet affected the splicing further underscores the importance of using cDNA for mutation analysis . The identification of four genomic rearrangements among 30 mutations suggests that genomic rearrangements are frequent germline APC mutations . .;oncological;['oncological']

Relative efficacy and toxicity of netilmicin and tobramycin in oncology patients.;We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of netilmicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate in conjunction with piperacillin sodium in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infections. The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious. Nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin (17% vs 11%). Ototoxicity occurred in four (9.5%) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 (22%) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients. Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and piperacillin-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients. The number of greater than or equal to 15-dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-dB changes (increases and decreases) was significantly lower in netilmicin and piperacillin- vs tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients (18 of 78 vs 67 of 115). We conclude that aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity was less severe and more often reversible with netilmicin than with tobramycin.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']
Frequency of transient ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia.;BACKGROUND: Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers. Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral paralysis. We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences. METHODS: This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic. RESULTS: All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis. It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis. In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.;neurological;['neurological']
Overgrowth of oral mucosa and facial skin, a novel feature of aspartylglucosaminuria.;Aspartylglucosaminuria ( AGU ) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of aspartylglucosaminidase ( AGA ) . The main symptom is progressive mental retardation . A spectrum of different mutations has been reported in this disease , one missense mutation ( Cys163Ser ) being responsible for the majority of Finnish cases . We were able to examine 66 Finnish AGU patients for changes in the oral mucosa and 44 of these for changes in facial skin . Biopsy specimens of 16 oral lesions , 12 of them associated with the teeth , plus two facial lesions were studied histologically . Immunohistochemical staining for AGA was performed on 15 oral specimens . Skin was seborrhoeic in adolescent and adult patients , with erythema of the facial skin already common in childhood . Of 44 patients , nine ( 20 % ) had facial angiofibromas , tumours primarily occurring in association with tuberous sclerosis . Oedemic buccal mucosa ( leucoedema ) and gingival overgrowths were more frequent in AGU patients than in controls ( p oral mucosal lesions studied histologically , 15 represented fibroepithelial or epithelial hyperplasias and were reactive in nature . Cytoplasmic vacuolisation was evident in four . Immunohistochemically , expression of AGA in AGU patients mucosal lesions did not differ from that seen in corresponding lesions of normal subjects . Thus , the high frequency of mucosal overgrowth in AGU patients does not appear to be directly associated with lysosomal storage or with alterations in the level of AGA expression .;oncological;['oncological']

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a practical review.;"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) remains under-recognized despite its potentially devastating outcomes. It begins when heparin exposure stimulates the formation of heparin-platelet factor 4 antibodies, which in turn triggers the release of procoagulant platelet particles. Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that follow comprise the 2 hallmark traits of HIT, with the former largely responsible for significant vascular complications. The prevalence of HIT varies among several subgroups, with greater incidence in surgical as compared with medical populations. HIT must be acknowledged for its intense predilection for thrombosis and suspected whenever thrombosis occurs after heparin exposure. Early recognition that incorporates the clinical and serologic clues is paramount to timely institution of treatment, as its delay may result in catastrophic outcomes. The treatment of HIT mandates an immediate cessation of all heparin exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy, most commonly using a direct thrombin inhibitor. Current ""diagnostic"" tests, which primarily include functional and antigenic assays, have more of a confirmatory than diagnostic role in the management of HIT. Special attention must be paid to cardiac patients who are often exposed to heparin multiple times during their course of treatment. Direct thrombin inhibitors are appropriate, evidence-based alternatives to heparin in patients with a history of HIT, who need to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. As heparin remains one of the most frequently used medications today with potential for HIT with every heparin exposure, a close vigilance of platelet counts must be practiced whenever heparin is initiated.";cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']
Arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy: a complication associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.;Arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therapy. Characteristic of the entity is arterial occlusion by platelet-fibrin thrombi with distal ischemia occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of heparin therapy, preceded by profound thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 per cubic millimeter. The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be ischemic in origin, and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications. Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of heparin are reviewed. The common factor relating thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia is heparin-induced platelet aggregation. Appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of heparin, and anticoagulation with sodium warfarin if necessary. Vascular procedures are performed as indicated.;neurological;['neurological']
Takotsubo syndrome (or apical ballooning syndrome) secondary to Zolmitriptan.;Takotsubo syndrome (TS), also known as broken heart syndrome, is characterized by left ventricle apical ballooning with elevated cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ie, ST-segment elevation, T wave inversions, and pathologic Q waves). We report a case of 54-year-old woman with medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines, who was admitted to the hospital for substernal chest pain and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1/2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 and positive troponin I. Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS. Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took zolmitriptan sparingly only when she had migraines. But before this event, she was taking zolmitriptan 2-3 times daily for several days because of a persistent migraine headache. She otherwise reported that she is quite active, rides horses, and does show jumping without any limitations in her physical activity. There was no evidence of any recent stress or status migrainosus.

Rearrangement is thought to deregulate a nearby protooncogene , but transcribed sequences in the immediate vicinity of BCL1 breakpoints had not been identified . PRAD1 , previously designated D11S287E , was identified on 11q13 as a chromosomal breakpoint region rearranged with the parathyroid hormone gene in a subset of parathyroid adenomas ; this highly conserved putative oncogene , which encodes a novel cyclin , has been linked to BCL1 and implicated also in subsets of breast and squamous cell neoplasms with 11q13 amplification . We report pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data showing BCL1 and PRAD1 to be no more than 130 kilobases apart . PRAD1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in seven of seven centrocytic lymphomas ( Kiel classification ) , in contrast to 13 closely related but noncentrocytic lymphomas . Three of the seven centrocytic lymphomas had detectable BCL1 DNA rearrangement . Also , two unusual cases of CLL with BCL1 rearrangement overexpressed PRAD1 , in contrast to five CLL controls .

Development of isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.;The development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol (ISO) (0.3 mg/kg body weight). A time course was established for the change in tissue mass, RNA and DNA content, as well as hydroxyproline content. Heart weight increased 44% after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3.4 days. Ventricular RNA content was elevated 26% after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therapy. The half time for RNA accumulation was 2.0 days. The total content of hydroxyproline remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46% after 4 days of therapy. Ventricular DNA content was unchanged during the early stage (1-4 days) of hypertrophic growth but increased to a new steady-state level 19% above the controls after 8 days of treatment. Intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed hypertrophy. However, dP/dt in the ISO-treated hearts was slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated. These data indicate that the adaptive response to ISO shows an early hypertrophic phase (1-4 days) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA. However, prolonged stimulation (8-12 days) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia within the heart.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']
Recombination events that locate myotonic dystrophy distal to APOC2 on 19q.;We previously reported a recombination in an individual with myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) which placed the markers D19S19 and APOC2 on the same side of the DM locus .

Conversion to sirolimus ameliorates cyclosporine-induced nephropathy in the rat: focus on serum, urine, gene, and protein renal expression biomarkers.;Protocols of conversion from cyclosporin A (CsA) to sirolimus (SRL) have been widely used in immunotherapy after transplantation to prevent CsA-induced nephropathy, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these protocols remain nuclear. This study aimed to identify the molecular pathways and putative biomarkers of CsA-to-SRL conversion in a rat model. Four animal groups (n = 6) were tested during 9 weeks: control, CsA, SRL, and conversion (CsA for 3 weeks followed by SRL for 6 weeks). Classical and emergent serum, urinary, and kidney tissue (gene and protein expression) markers were assessed. Renal lesions were analyzed in hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson's trichrome stains. SRL-treated rats presented proteinuria and NGAL (serum and urinary) as the best markers of renal impairment. Short CsA treatment presented slight or even absent kidney lesions and TGF-b, NF- kb, mTOR, PCNA, TP53, KIM-1, and CTGF as relevant gene and protein changes. Prolonged CsA exposure aggravated renal damage, without clear changes on the traditional markers, but with changes in serums TGF- b and IL-7, TBARs clearance, and kidney TGF-b and mTOR. Conversion to SRL prevented CsA-induced renal damage evolution (absent/mild grade lesions), while NGAL (serum versus urine) seems to be a feasible biomarker of CsA replacement to SRL.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-naloxone (8 nM), and naloxone, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nM). These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors. As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site, the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha-methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone.;neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']

Ketamine sedation for the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department.;"BACKGROUND: There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of ketamine, a unique anesthetic, for emergency-department procedures requiring sedation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children's fractures in the emergency department. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen children (average age, 5.3 years; range, twelve months to ten years and ten months) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level-I trauma center were prospectively evaluated. Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously (at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety-nine of the patients and intramuscularly (at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen. A board-certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse. Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS). RESULTS: The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes). The average score according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6.4 points (range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction. Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children. Ninety-nine percent (sixty-eight) of the sixty-nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation. Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable. Minor side effects included nausea (thirteen patients), emesis (eight of the thirteen patients with nausea), clumsiness (evident as ataxic movements in ten patients), and dysphoric reaction (one patient). No long-term sequelae were noted, and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department at our institution. Ketamine should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department, where proper one-on-one monitoring is used and board-certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient.";neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']
Massive proteinuria and acute renal failure after oral bisphosphonate (alendronate) administration in a patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.;A 61-year-old Japanese man with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was initially responding well to steroid therapy. The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15.6 to 2.8 g. Within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate (alendronate sodium) administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with acute renal failure. After discontinuing the oral alendronate, the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis. Urinary volume and serum creatinine levels recovered to the normal range, with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days. This report demonstrates that not only intravenous, but also oral bisphosphonates can aggravate proteinuria and acute renal failure.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

In Swedish families with hereditary prostate cancer, linkage to the HPC1 locus on chromosome 1q24-25 is restricted to families with early-onset prostate cancer.;Prostate cancer clusters in some families , and an estimated 5 % -10 % of all cases are estimated to result from inheritance of prostate cancer-susceptibility genes . We previously reported evidence of linkage to the 1q24-25 region ( HPC1 ) in 91 North American and Swedish families each with multiple cases of prostate cancer ( Smith et al . 1996 ) .

Thiopentone pretreatment for propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients.;"This study investigated propofol injection pain in patients undergoing ambulatory anaesthesia. In a randomized, double-blind trial, 90 women were allocated to receive one of three treatments prior to induction of anaesthesia with propofol. Patients in Group C received 2 ml normal saline, Group L, 2 ml, lidocaine 2% (40 mg) and Group T, 2 ml thiopentone 2.5% (50 mg). Venous discomfort was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS) 5-15 sec after commencing propofol administration using an infusion pump (rate 1000 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Loss of consciousness occurred in 60-90 sec. Visual analogue scores (mean +/- SD) during induction were lower in Groups L (3.3 +/- 2.5) and T (4.1 +/- 2.7) than in Group C (5.6 +/- 2.3); P = 0.0031. The incidence of venous discomfort was lower in Group L (76.6%; P < 0.05) than in Group C (100%) but not different from Group T (90%). The VAS scores for recall of pain in the recovery room were correlated with the VAS scores during induction (r = 0.7045; P < 0.0001). Recovery room discharge times were similar: C (75.9 +/- 19.4 min); L 73.6 +/- 21.6 min); T (77.1 +/- 18.9 min). Assessing their overall satisfaction, 89.7% would choose propofol anaesthesia again. We conclude that lidocaine reduces the incidence and severity of propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients whereas thiopentone only reduces its severity.";neurological;['neurological']
Late recovery of renal function in a woman with the hemolytic uremic syndrome.;"A case is reported of the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in a woman taking oral contraceptives. She was treated with heparin, dipyridamole and hemodialysis; and after more than three months, her urinary output rose above 500 ml; and six months after the onset of anuria, dialysis treatment was stopped. This case emphasizes the possibility that HUS in adults is not invariably irreversible and that, despite prolonged oliguria, recovery of renal function can be obtained. Therefore, in adult patients affected by HUS, dialysis should not be discontinued prematurely; moreover, bilateral nephrectomy, for treatment of severe hypertension and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, should be performed with caution.";cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']
Safety and efficacy of fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (0.59 mg) in birdshot retinochoroidopathy.;PURPOSE: To report the treatment outcomes of the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (0.59 mg) in patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy whose disease is refractory or intolerant to conventional immunomodulatory therapy. METHODS: A retrospective case series involving 11 birdshot retinochoroidopathy patients (11 eyes). Eleven patients (11 eyes) underwent surgery for fluocinolone acetonide implant (0.59 mg). Treatment outcomes of interest were noted at baseline, before fluocinolone acetonide implant, and then at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and beyond 3 years. Disease activity markers, including signs of ocular inflammation, evidence of retinal vasculitis, Swedish interactive threshold algorithm-short wavelength automated perimetry Humphrey visual field analysis, electroretinographic parameters, and optical coherence tomography were recorded. Data on occurrence of cataract and raised intraocular pressure were collected in all eyes. RESULTS: Intraocular inflammation was present in 54.5, 9.9, 11.1, and 0% of patients at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and beyond 3 years after receiving the implant, respectively. Active vasculitis was noted in 36.3% patients at baseline and 0% at 3 years of follow-up. More than 20% (47.61-67.2%) reduction in central retinal thickness was noted in all patients with cystoid macular edema at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postimplant. At baseline, 54.5% patients were on immunomodulatory agents. This percentage decreased to 45.45, 44.4, and 14.28% at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postimplant, respectively. Adverse events included increased intraocular pressure (54.5%) and cataract formation (100%). CONCLUSION: The data suggest that fluocinolone acetonide implant (0.59 mg) helps to control inflammation in otherwise treatment-refractory cases of birdshot retinochoroidopathy. It is associated with significant side effects of cataract and ocular hypertension requiring treatment.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']
Ifosfamide encephalopathy presenting with asterixis.;CNS toxic effects of the antineoplastic agent ifosfamide (IFX) are frequent and include a variety of neurological symptoms that can limit drug use. We report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative myoclonus of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of ifosfamide for plasmacytoma. He was awake, revealed no changes of mental status and at rest there were no further motor symptoms. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and extensive laboratory studies failed to reveal structural lesions of the brain and metabolic abnormalities. An electroencephalogram showed continuous, generalized irregular slowing with admixed periodic triphasic waves indicating symptomatic encephalopathy. The administration of ifosfamide was discontinued and within 12 h the asterixis resolved completely. In the patient described, the presence of asterixis during infusion of ifosfamide, normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative myoclonus is associated with the use of IFX.;neurological;['neurological']

The expression level of all the Kell antigens in erythrocyte was decreased and molecular analysis revealed a single-base ( T ) deletion at the nucleotide position 1095 in XK . This deletion caused a frameshift in translation , leading to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 408 .

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, a novel effector for the GTPase CDC42Hs, is implicated in actin polymerization.;The Rho family of GTPases control diverse biological processes , including cell morphology and mitogenesis . We have identified WASP , the protein that is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) , as a novel effector for CDC42Hs , but not for the other Rho family members , Rac and Rho . This interaction is dependent on the presence of the G protein-binding domain . Cellular expression of epitope-tagged WASP produces clusters of WASP that are highly enriched in polymerized actin . This clustering is not observed with a C-terminally deleted WASP and is inhibited by coexpression with dominant negative CDC42Hs-N17 , but not with dominant negative forms of Rac or Rho . Thus , WASP provides a novel link between CDC42Hs and the actin cytoskeleton , which suggests a molecular mechanism for many of the cellular abnormalities in WAS . The WASP sequence contains two novel domains that are homologous to other proteins involved in action organization . .;neurological;['neurological']

Sub-chronic inhibition of nitric-oxide synthesis modifies haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of NADPH-diaphorase neurons in mice.;RATIONALE: NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), induces catalepsy in mice. This effect undergoes rapid tolerance, showing a significant decrease after 2 days of sub-chronic L-NOARG treatment. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to influence dopaminergic neurotransmission in the striatum. Neuroleptic drugs such as haloperidol, which block dopamine receptors, also cause catalepsy in rodents. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of subchronic L-NOARG treatment in haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of NOS neurons in areas related to motor control. METHODS: Male albino Swiss mice were treated sub-chronically (twice a day for 4 days) with L-NOARG (40 mg/kg i.p.) or haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.). Catalepsy was evaluated at the beginning and the end of the treatments. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry was also employed to visualize NOS as an index of enzyme expression in mice brain regions related to motor control. RESULTS: L-NOARG sub-chronic administration produced tolerance of L-NOARG and of haloperidol-induced catalepsy. It also induced an increase in the number of NADPH-d-positive cells in the dorsal part of the caudate and accumbens nuclei compared with haloperidol and in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus compared with saline. In contrast, there was a decrease in NADPH-d neuron number in the substantia nigra, pars compacta in both haloperidol-treated and L-NOARG-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: The results give further support to the hypothesis that NO plays a role in motor behavior control and suggest that it may take part in the synaptic changes produced by antipsychotic treatment.;neurological;['neurological']

Late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy in Israel.;"Metachromatic Leukodystrophy ( MLD ) is a neurodegenerative disease in which the lysosomal enzyme , Aryl sulfatase A ( ARSA ) is deficient . The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and its frequency is estimated to be 1 / 40 , 000 live births . The gene of ARSA has been cloned and up to now eight mutations causing MLD have been reported . Another mutation , PD , leads to the deficiency of the enzyme in vitro ( pseudodeficiency ) without any known clinical effect . The PD mutation is frequent in all populations . In Israel , late infantile MLD was found to be very frequent in a small Jewish isolate , the Habbanite Jews ( 1 / 75 live births ) . The molecular analysis demonstrated that in the Habbanite population , the mutation occurred on an allele with the PD mutation . The loss of ARSA activity is due to a point mutation C > T leading to a change of proline to leucine . MLD is also frequent among Moslem Arabs in Jerusalem . The mutation is a transition G > A destroying the splice donor site of exon 2 . This mutation has been reported in patients with the late infantile MLD from different ethnic groups . The Christian Arabs in Israel also have a high incidence of the disease ( 1 / 10 , 000 live births ) ; the mutation in this population is still unknown . Knowledge of the different mutations causing MLD in these defined populations will allow a carrier screening program to be carried out and prevent the birth of additional affected children . .";neurological;['neurological']
Acute vocal fold palsy after acute disulfiram intoxication.;Acute peripheral neuropathy caused by a disulfiram overdose is very rare and there is no report of it leading to vocal fold palsy. A 49-year-old woman was transferred to our department because of quadriparesis, lancinating pain, sensory loss, and paresthesia of the distal limbs. One month previously, she had taken a single high dose of disulfiram (130 tablets of ALCOHOL STOP TAB, Shin-Poong Pharm. Co., Ansan, Korea) in a suicide attempt. She was not an alcoholic. For the first few days after ingestion, she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate ataxia and giddiness. She noticed hoarseness and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state. A nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Laryngeal electromyography (thyroarytenoid muscle) showed ample denervation potentials. Laryngoscopy revealed asymmetric vocal fold movements during phonation. Her vocal change and weakness began to improve spontaneously about 3 weeks after transfer. This was a case of acute palsy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and superimposed severe acute sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy caused by high-dose disulfiram intoxication.;neurological;['neurological']

Mesangial function and glomerular sclerosis in rats with aminonucleoside nephrosis.;"The possible relationship between mesangial dysfunction and development of glomerular sclerosis was studied in the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) model. Five male Wistar rats received repeated subcutaneous PAN injections; five controls received saline only. After 4 weeks the PAN rats were severely proteinuric (190 +/- 80 mg/24 hr), and all rats were given colloidal carbon (CC) intravenously. At 5 months glomerular sclerosis was found in 7.6 +/- 3.4% of the glomeruli of PAN rats; glomeruli of the controls were normal. Glomeruli of PAN rats contained significantly more CC than glomeruli of controls. Glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more CC than non-sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys. CC was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomeruli. Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic PAN treatment, we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where sclerosis will develop subsequently. Cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the PAN glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this model. Similar to the remnant kidney model in PAN nephrosis the development of glomerular sclerosis may be related to ""mesangial overloading.""";hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Study of the role of vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing hematologic toxicity of zidovudine.;"A prospective, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing zidovudine (ZDV)-induced bone marrow suppression. Seventy-five human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts < 500/mm3 were randomized to receive either ZDV (500 mg daily) alone (group I, n = 38) or in combination with folinic acid (15 mg daily) and intramascular vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms monthly) (group II, n = 37). Finally, 15 patients were excluded from the study (noncompliance 14, death 1); thus, 60 patients (31 in group I and 29 in group II) were eligible for analysis. No significant differences between groups were found at enrollment. During the study, vitamin B12 and folate levels were significantly higher in group II patients; however, no differences in hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and white-cell, neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Severe hematologic toxicity (neutrophil count < 1000/mm3 and/or hemoglobin < 8 g/dl) occurred in 4 patients assigned to group I and 7 assigned to group II. There was no correlation between vitamin B12 or folate levels and development of myelosuppression. Vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation of ZDV therapy does not seem useful in preventing or reducing ZDV-induced myelotoxicity in the overall treated population, although a beneficial effect in certain subgroups of patients cannot be excluded.";neurological;['neurological']
Efficacy and proarrhythmia with the use of d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.;"This study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy, the incidence of torsades de pointes, and the presumable risk factors for torsades de pointes in patients treated with d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Eighty-one consecutive patients (54 with coronary artery disease, and 20 with dilated cardiomyopathy) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation received oral d,l-sotalol to prevent induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia. During oral loading with d,l-sotalol, continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was performed. Those patients in whom d,l-sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 +/- 18 months. Induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was prevented by oral d,l-sotalol in 35 (43%) patients; the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible in 40 (49%) patients; and two (2.5%) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d,l-sotalol once daily. Four (5%) patients had from torsades de pointes during the initial oral treatment with d,l-sotalol. Neither ECG [sinus-cycle length (SCL), QT or QTc interval, or U wave] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for torsades de pointes. However, the oral dose of d,l-sotalol was significantly lower in patients with torsades de pointes (200 +/- 46 vs. 328 +/- 53 mg/day; p = 0.0017). Risk factors associated with the development of torsades de pointes were the appearance of an U wave (p = 0.049), female gender (p = 0.015), and significant dose-corrected changes of SCL, QT interval, and QTc interval (p < 0.05). During follow-up, seven (20%) patients had a nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence, and two (6%) patients died suddenly. One female patient with stable cardiac disease had recurrent torsades de pointes after 2 years of successful treatment with d,l-sotalol. Torsades de pointes occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral d,l-sotalol. Pronounced changes in the surface ECG (cycle length, QT, and QTc) in relation to the dose of oral d,l-sotalol might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for torsades de pointes. Other ECG parameters before the application of d,l-sotalol did not identify patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes. Recurrence rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias are high despite complete suppression of the arrhythmia during programmed stimulation. Therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of d,l-sotalol seems to be of limited prognostic value.";neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']

Modification by propranolol of cardiovascular effects of induced hypoglycaemia.;The cardiovascular effects of hypoglycaemia, with and without beta-blockade, were compared in fourteen healthy men. Eight received insulin alone, and eight, including two of the original insulin-only group, were given propranolol and insulin. In the insulin-group the period of hypoglycaemia was associated with an increase in heart-rate and a fall in diastolic blood-pressure. In the propranolol-insulin group there was a significant fall in heart-rate in most subjects and an increase in diastolic pressure. Typical S-T/T changes occurred in the insulin-group but in none of the propranolol-insulin group. Hypertension in diabetics prone to hypoglycaemia attacks should not be treated with beta-blockers because these drugs may cause a sharp rise in blood-pressure in such patients.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']

Medical and psychiatric outcomes for patients transplanted for acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure: a case-control study.;"BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the UK. Patients often consume the drug with suicidal intent or with a background of substance dependence. AIMS AND METHODS: We compared the severity of pretransplant illness, psychiatric co-morbidity, medical and psychosocial outcomes of all patients who had undergone liver transplantation (LT) emergently between 1999-2004 for acetaminophen-induced ALF (n=36) with age- and sex-matched patients undergoing emergent LT for non-acetaminophen-induced ALF (n=35) and elective LT for chronic liver disease (CLD, n=34). RESULTS: Acetaminophen-induced ALF patients undergoing LT had a greater severity of pre-LT illness reflected by higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and requirement for organ support compared with the other two groups. Twenty (56%) acetaminophen-induced ALF patients had a formal psychiatric diagnosis before LT (non-acetaminophen-induced ALF=0/35, CLD=2/34; P<0.01 for all) and nine (25%) had a previous suicide attempt. During follow-up (median 5 years), there were no significant differences in rejection (acute and chronic), graft failure or survival between the groups (acetaminophen-induced ALF 1 year 87%, 5 years 75%; non-acetaminophen-induced ALF 88%, 78%; CLD 93%, 82%: P>0.6 log rank). Two acetaminophen-induced ALF patients reattempted suicide post-LT (one died 8 years post-LT). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high prevalence of psychiatric disturbance, outcomes for patients transplanted emergently for acetaminophen-induced ALF were comparable to those transplanted for non-acetaminophen-induced ALF and electively for CLD. Multidisciplinary approaches with long-term psychiatric follow-up may contribute to low post-transplant suicide rates seen and low rates of graft loss because of non-compliance.";neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']
A population-based study of the clinical expression of the hemochromatosis gene.;"BACKGROUND AND METHODS  Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis ( HFE ) gene on chromosome 6 , elevated serum transferrin saturation , and excess iron deposits throughout the body . To assess the prevalence and clinical expression of the HFE gene , we conducted a population-based study in Busselton , Australia . In 1994 , we obtained blood samples for the determination of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels and the presence or absence of the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation ( which may contribute to increased hepatic iron levels ) in 3011 unrelated white adults . We evaluated all subjects who had persistently elevated transferrin-saturation values ( 45 percent or higher ) or were homozygous for the C282Y mutation . We recommended liver biopsy for subjects with serum ferritin levels of 300 ng per milliliter or higher . The subjects were followed for up to four years . RESULTS  Sixteen of the subjects ( 0 . 5 percent ) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation , and 424 ( 14 . 1 percent ) were heterozygous . The serum transferrin saturation was 45 percent or higher in 15 of the 16 who were homozygous ; in 1 subject it was 43 percent . Four of the homozygous subjects had previously been given a diagnosis of hemochromatosis , and 12 had not . Seven of these 12 patients had elevated serum ferritin levels in 1994 ; 6 of the 7 had further increases in 1998 , and 1 had a decrease , although the value remained elevated . The serum ferritin levels in the four other homozygous patients remained in the normal range . Eleven of the 16 homozygous subjects underwent liver biopsy ; 3 had hepatic fibrosis , and 1 , who had a history of excessive alcohol consumption , had cirrhosis and mild microvesicular steatosis . Eight of the 16 homozygous subjects had clinical findings that were consistent with the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis , such as hepatomegaly , skin pigmentation , and arthritis . CONCLUSIONS  In a population of white adults of northern European ancestry , 0 . 5 percent were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene . However , only half of those who were homozygous had clinical features of hemochromatosis , and one quarter had serum ferritin levels that remained normal over a four-year period .";hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']
Focal cerebral ischemia in rats: effect of phenylephrine-induced hypertension during reperfusion.;"After 180 min of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats, the effect of phenylephrine-induced hypertension on ischemic brain injury and blood-brain barrier permeability was determined. Blood pressure was manipulated by one of the following schedules during 120 min of reperfusion: Control, normotensive reperfusion; 90/hypertension (90/HTN), blood pressure was increased by 35 mm Hg during the initial 90 min of reperfusion only; 15/hypertension (15/HTN), normotensive reperfusion for 30 min followed by 15 min of hypertension and 75 min of normotension. Part A, for eight rats in each group brain injury was evaluated by staining tissue using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and edema was evaluated by microgravimetry. Part B, for eight different rats in each group blood-brain barrier permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount and extent of extravasation of Evans Blue dye. Brain injury (percentage of the ischemic hemisphere) was less in the 15/HTN group (16 +/- 6, mean +/- SD) versus the 90/HTN group (30 +/- 6), which was in turn less than the control group (42 +/- 5). Specific gravity was greater in the 15/HTN group (1.043 +/- 0.002) versus the 90/HTN (1.036 +/- 0.003) and control (1.037 +/- 0.003) groups. Evans Blue (mug g-1 of brain tissue) was greater in the 90/HTN group (24.4 +/- 6.0) versus the control group (12.3 +/- 4.1), which was in turn greater than the 15/HTN group (7.3 +/- 3.2). This study supports a hypothesis that during reperfusion, a short interval of hypertension decreases brain injury and edema; and that sustained hypertension increases the risk of vasogenic edema.";neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']

Kidney function and morphology after short-term combination therapy with cyclosporine A, tacrolimus and sirolimus in the rat.;BACKGROUND: Sirolimus (SRL) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation. These are nephrotoxic, but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects, although this question is still open. In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described. The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function, including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus (FK506) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations. METHODS: For a period of 2 weeks, CsA 15 mg/kg/day (given orally), FK506 3.0 mg/kg/day (given orally) or SRL 0.4 mg/kg/day (given intraperitoneally) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 'conscious catheterized rat' model, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured as the clearance of Cr(EDTA). The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi-quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis, subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules, plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red. RESULTS: CsA, FK506 and SRL all significantly decreased the GFR. A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL, whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared with treatment with any of the single substances. The morphological changes presented a similar pattern. The semi-quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL (P<0.001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls (P<0.02). The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls (P=0.05). CONCLUSION: This rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of CsA plus SRL, whereas FK506 plus SRL was better tolerated.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']
Constitutive and regulated modes of splicing produce six major myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) isoforms with distinct properties.;Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is the most prevalent inherited neuromuscular disease in adults . The genetic defect is a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( DMPK ) gene , consisting of 15 exons . Using a transgenic DMPK-overexpressor mouse model , we demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse DMPK gene and the human DMPK transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mRNAs which have almost identical cell type-dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns . Use of a cryptic 5 splice site in exon 8 , which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides specifying a VSGGG peptide motif , and / or use of a cryptic 3 splice site in exon 14 , which leads to a frameshift in the mRNA reading frame , occur as independent stochastic events in all tissues examined . In contrast , the excision of exons 13 / 14 that causes a frameshift and creates a C-terminally truncated protein is clearly cell type dependent and occurs predominantly in smooth muscle . We generated all six full-length mouse cDNAs that result from combinations of these three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kDa full-length ( heart- , skeletal muscle- or brain-specific ) and two C-terminally truncated approximately 68 kDa ( smooth muscle-specific ) isoforms . Information on DMPK mRNA and protein isoform expression patterns will be useful for recognizing differential effects of ( CTG ) ( n ) expansion in DM manifestation . .;neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']

Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.;Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side-effects, the most problematic being pneumonitis. The pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell-mediated hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The clinical and radiographic features of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity are characteristic but nonspecific. The diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities, such as heart failure, infection, and malignancy. While withdrawal of amiodarone leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases, this is not always possible or advisable. Dose reduction or concomitant steroid therapy may have a role in selected patients.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']
Methylphenidate-induced obsessive-compulsive symptoms in an elderly man.;An 82-year-old man with treatment-resistant depression and early Alzheimer's disease was started on methylphenidate. Significant obsessive-compulsive behavior ensued but diminished over several weeks when methylphenidate was replaced by fluvoxamine. The patient had no prior psychiatric history, but he had a sister with obsessive-compulsive disorder. It appears that methylphenidate precipitated the patient's pathological behavior.;neurological;['neurological']
Bradycardia due to biperiden.;In a 38-year-old male patient suffering from a severe postzosteric trigeminal neuralgia, intravenous application of 10 mg biperiden lactate led to a long-lasting paradoxical reaction characterized by considerable bradycardia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. The heart rate was back to normal within 12 hours upon administration of orciprenaline under cardiac monitoring in an intensive care unit. Bradycardia induced by biperiden is attributed to the speed of injection and to a dose-related dual effect of atropine-like drugs on muscarine receptors.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']
Expression of the murine Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in muscle and brain.;Complementary DNA clones were isolated that represent the 5 terminal 2 . 5 kilobases of the murine Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( Dmd ) messenger RNA ( mRNA ) . Mouse Dmd mRNA was detectable in skeletal and cardiac muscle and at a level approximately 90 percent lower in brain . Dmd mRNA is also present , but at much lower than normal levels , in both the muscle and brain of three different strains of dystrophic mdx mice . The identification of Dmd mRNA in brain raises the possibility of a relation between human Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) gene expression and the mental retardation found in some DMD males . These results also provide evidence that the mdx mutations are allelic variants of mouse Dmd gene mutations .;neurological;['neurological']
Norrie disease gene: characterization of deletions and possible function.;"Positional cloning experiments have resulted recently in the isolation of a candidate gene for Norrie disease ( pseudoglioma ; NDP ) , a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder . Here we report the isolation and analysis of human genomic DNA clones encompassing the NDP gene . The gene spans 28 kb and consists of 3 exons , the first of which is entirely contained within the 5 untranslated region . Detailed analysis of genomic deletions in Norrie patients shows that they are heterogeneous , both in size and in position . By PCR analysis , we found that expression of the NDP gene was not confined to the eye or to the brain . An extensive DNA and protein sequence comparison between the human NDP gene and related genes from the database revealed homology with cysteine-rich protein-binding domains of immediate--early genes implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation . We propose that NDP is a molecule related in function to these genes and may be involved in a pathway that regulates neural cell differentiation and proliferation . .";neurological;['neurological']
Adequate timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C.;BACKGROUND: Hemolytic anemia is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin. Because of ribavirin-related hemolytic anemia, dose reduction is a common event in this therapy. In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy. METHODS: Thirty-seven of 160 patients who had HCV-genotype 1b, had high virus load, and received 24-week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level <10 g/dl or anemia-related signs during therapy. After that, these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin (200 mg) per day. After reduction of ribavirin, 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks (group A). However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia-related severe side effects occurred (group B). We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups A and B. RESULTS: A sustained virological response (SVR) was 29.6% (8/27) in group A and 10% (1/10) in group B, respectively. A 34.4% (12/27) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10% (1/10) in group B ( P = 0.051), with slight significance. With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of ribavirin reduction, a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or =10 g/dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with <10 g/dl ( P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of ribavirin at hemoglobin level > or =10 g/dl is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Reversal of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy by novel aryl-piperazine anxiolytic drugs.;The novel anxiolytic drug, buspirone, reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol. A series of aryl-piperazine analogues of buspirone and other 5-hydroxytryptaminergic agonists were tested for their ability to reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy. Those drugs with strong affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy. Drugs with affinity for other 5-HT receptors or weak affinity were ineffective. However, inhibition of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of catalepsy and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect.;neurological;['neurological']

Mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype analyses in Cowden disease and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, two hamartoma syndromes with germline PTEN mutation.;"The tumour suppressor gene PTEN , which maps to 10q23 . 3 and encodes a 403 amino acid dual specificity phosphatase ( protein tyrosine phosphatase ; PTPase ) , was shown recently to play a broad role in human malignancy . Somatic PTEN deletions and mutations were observed in sporadic breast , brain , prostate and kidney cancer cell lines and in several primary tumours such as endometrial carcinomas , malignant melanoma and thyroid tumours . In addition , PTEN was identified as the susceptibility gene for two hamartoma syndromes  Cowden disease ( CD ; MIM 158350 ) and Bannayan-Zonana ( BZS ) or Ruvalcaba-Riley-Smith syndrome ( MIM 153480 ) . Constitutive DNA from 37 CD families and seven BZS families was screened for germline PTEN mutations . PTEN mutations were identified in 30 of 37 ( 81 % ) CD families , including missense and nonsense point mutations , deletions , insertions , a deletion / insertion and splice site mutations . These mutations were scattered over the entire length of PTEN , with the exception of the first , fourth and last exons . A hot spot for PTEN mutation in CD was identified in exon 5 that contains the PTPase core motif , with 13 of 30 ( 43 % ) CD mutations identified in this exon . Seven of 30 ( 23 % ) were within the core motif , the majority ( five of seven ) of which were missense mutations , possibly pointing to the functional significance of this region . Germline PTEN mutations were identified in four of seven ( 57 % ) BZS families studied . Interestingly , none of these mutations was observed in the PTPase core motif . It is also worthy of note that a single nonsense point mutation , R233X , was observed in the germline DNA from two unrelated CD families and one BZS family . Genotype-phenotype studies were not performed on this small group of BZS families . However , genotype-phenotype analysis inthe group of CD families revealed two possible associations worthy of follow-up in independent analyses . The first was an association noted in the group of CD families with breast disease . A correlation was observed between the presence / absence of a PTEN mutation and the type of breast involvement ( unaffected versus benign versus malignant ) . Specifically and more directly , an association was also observed between the presence of a PTEN mutation and malignant breast disease . Secondly , there appeared to be an interdependent association between mutations upstream and within the PTPase core motif , the core motif containing the majority of missense mutations , and the involvement of all major organ systems ( central nervous system , thyroid , breast , skin and gastrointestinal tract ) . However , these observations would need to be confirmed by studying a larger number of CD families .";neurological|hepatorenal|oncological;['neurological', 'hepatorenal', 'oncological']
Delirium in a patient with toxic flecainide plasma concentrations: the role of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with paroxetine.;"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of flecainide-induced delirium associated with a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with paroxetine. CASE SUMMARY: A 69-year-old white female presented to the emergency department with a history of confusion and paranoia over the past several days. On admission the patient was taking carvedilol 12 mg twice daily, warfarin 2 mg/day, folic acid 1 mg/day, levothyroxine 100 microg/day, pantoprazole 40 mg/day, paroxetine 40 mg/day, and flecainide 100 mg twice daily. Flecainide had been started 2 weeks prior for atrial fibrillation. Laboratory test findings on admission were notable only for a flecainide plasma concentration of 1360 microg/L (reference range 200-1000). A metabolic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine, which the patient had been taking for more than 5 years, was considered. Paroxetine was discontinued and the dose of flecainide was reduced to 50 mg twice daily. Her delirium resolved 3 days later. DISCUSSION: Flecainide and pharmacologically similar agents that interact with sodium channels may cause delirium in susceptible patients. A MEDLINE search (1966-January 2009) revealed one in vivo pharmacokinetic study on the interaction between flecainide, a CYP2D6 substrate, and paroxetine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as well as 3 case reports of flecainide-induced delirium. According to the Naranjo probability scale, flecainide was the probable cause of the patient's delirium; the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicates a possible pharmacokinetic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine. CONCLUSIONS: Supratherapeutic flecainide plasma concentrations may cause delirium. Because toxicity may occur when flecainide is prescribed with paroxetine and other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, flecainide plasma concentrations should be monitored closely with commencement of CYP2D6 inhibitors.";cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']
Transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of the high mobility group I-C protein develop adiposity and an abnormally high prevalence of lipomas.;Chromosomal translocations in human lipomas frequently create fusion transcripts encoding high mobility group ( HMG ) I-C DNA-binding domains and C-terminal sequences from different presumed transcription factors , suggesting a potential role for HMG I-C in the development of lipomas . To evaluate the role of the HMG I-C component , the three DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C have now been expressed in transgenic mice . Despite the ubiquitous expression of the truncated HMG I-C protein , the transgenic mice develop a selective abundance of fat tissue early in life , show marked adipose tissue inflammation , and have an abnormally high incidence of lipomas . These findings demonstrate that the DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C , in the absence of a C-terminal fusion partner , are sufficient to perturb adipogenesis and predispose to lipomas . We provide data supporting the central utility of this animal model as a tool to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of one of the most common kind of human benign tumors . .;oncological;['oncological']

Cardiovascular effects of hypotension induced by adenosine triphosphate and sodium nitroprusside on dogs with denervated hearts.;"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) are administered to patients to induce and control hypotension during anesthesia. SNP is authorized for clinical use in USA and UK, and ATP is clinically used in other countries such as Japan. We investigated how these two drugs act on the cardiovascular systems of 20 dogs whose hearts had been denervated by a procedure we had devised. ATP (10 dogs) or SNP (10 dogs) was administered to reduce mean arterial pressure by 30% to 70% of control. Before, during and after induced hypotension, we measured major cardiovascular parameters. Hypotension induced by ATP was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.001), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.001), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), total body oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05), and heart rate (p less than 0.001); all these variables returned normal within 30 min after ATP was stopped. Cardiac output did not change. During hypotension produced by SNP similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.01), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), and oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood (p less than 0.05), while heart rate (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.05) were increased. Recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after SNP had been stopped. Both ATP and SNP should act on the pacemaker tissue of the heart.";neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']
Epidural blood flow during prostaglandin E1 or trimethaphan induced hypotension.;To evaluate the effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or trimethaphan (TMP) induced hypotension on epidural blood flow (EBF) during spinal surgery, EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero-lateral interbody fusion under isoflurane anaesthesia. An initial dose of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 of PGE1 (15 patients), or 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of TMP (15 patients) was administered intravenously after the dural opening and the dose was adjusted to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at about 60 mmHg. The hypotensive drug was discontinued at the completion of the operative procedure. After starting PGE1 or TMP, MAP and rate pressure product (RPP) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values (P < 0.01), and the degree of hypotension due to PGE1 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation. Heart rate (HR) did not change in either group. EBFF did not change during PGE1 infusion whereas in the TMP group, EBF decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the start of TMP (preinfusion: 45.9 +/- 13.9 ml/100g/min. 30 min: 32.3 +/- 9.9 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.05). 60 min: 30 +/- 7.5 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.05)). These results suggest that PGE1 may be preferable to TMP for hypotensive anaesthesia in spinal surgery because TMP decreased EBF.;neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']

This study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane. The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane-induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane, and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models. Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver. In the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats. This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and/or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration. The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Peripheral neuropathy caused by high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.;"The central nervous system toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside is well recognized, but the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported. A 49-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. After he achieved complete remission, he received high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment (2 g/m2 twice a day for 5 days; total, 20 g/m2) as consolidation therapy. The first course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside resulted in no unusual symptoms, but on day 21 of the second course of treatment, the patient complained of numbness in his right foot. Electromyogram and nerve-conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy in both peroneal nerves. This neuropathy was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of graft-versus-host disease, and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone. Although the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy are still unclear, high-dose cytosine arabinoside is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system, and auto/alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms.";neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']

A phase I/II study of paclitaxel plus cisplatin as first-line therapy for head and neck cancers: preliminary results.;"Improved outcomes among patients with head and neck carcinomas require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy. Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single-agent paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) reported a 37% response rate in patients with head and neck cancer, and the paclitaxel/cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients. We initiated a phase I/II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed-dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma. To date, 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial. Primary tumor sites were oropharynx, 10 patients; hypopharynx, four; larynx, two; oral cavity, three; unknown primary, two; and nasal cavity and parotid gland, one each. Of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity, four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease. Treatment, given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles, consisted of paclitaxel by 3-hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg/m2). The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits. At the time of this writing, dose level 4 (260, 270, and 280 mg/m2) is being evaluated; three patients from this level are evaluable. With paclitaxel doses of 200 mg/m2 and higher, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d is given (days 4 through 12). Of 18 patients evaluable for response, seven (39%) achieved a complete response and six (33%) achieved a partial response. Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two. The overall response rate is 72%. Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery/radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy. Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses. Alopecia, paresthesias, and arthralgias/myalgias have occurred frequently, but with one exception (a grade 3 myalgia) they have been grade 1 or 2. No dose-limiting hematologic toxicity has been seen. Paclitaxel/cisplatin is an effective first-line regimen for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer and continued study is warranted. Results thus far suggest no dose-response effect for paclitaxel doses above 200 mg/m2.";neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']
Temocapril, a long-acting non-SH group angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, modulates glomerular injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis.;The purpose of the present study was to determine whether chronic administration of temocapril, a long-acting non-SH group angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduced proteinuria, inhibited glomerular hypertrophy and prevented glomerulosclerosis in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) - induced nephrotic rats. Nephrosis was induced by injection of PAN (15mg/100g body weight) in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Four groups were used, i) the PAN group (14), ii) PAN/temocapril (13), iii) temocapril (14) and iv) untreated controls (15). Temocapril (8 mg/kg/day) was administered to the rats which were killed at weeks 4, 14 or 20. At each time point, systolic blood pressure (BP), urinary protein excretion and renal histopathological findings were evaluated, and morphometric image analysis was done. Systolic BP in the PAN group was significantly high at 4, 14 and 20 weeks, but was normal in the PAN/temocapril group. Urinary protein excretion in the PAN group increased significantly, peaking at 8 days, then decreased at 4 weeks, but rose again significantly at 14 and 20 weeks. Temocapril did not attenuate proteinuria at 8 days, but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20. The glomerulosclerosis index (GSI) was 6.21 % at 4 weeks and respectively 25.35 % and 30.49 % at 14 and 20 weeks in the PAN group. There was a significant correlation between urinary protein excretion and GSI (r = 0.808, p < 0.0001). The ratio of glomerular tuft area to the area of Bowman's capsules (GT/BC) in the PAN group was significantly increased, but it was significantly lower in the PAN/temocapril group. It appears that temocapril was effective in retarding renal progression and protected renal function in PAN neprotic rats.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']
Hepatonecrosis and cholangitis related to long-term phenobarbital therapy: an autopsy report of two patients.;Phenobarbital (PB) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that PB-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease. Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with PB who died suddenly: one as consequence of cardiac arrest, the other of acute bronchopneumonia. At autopsy, analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate, which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells, associated with several foci of necrosis surrounded by a hard ring of non-specific granulomatous tissue. Inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen. Our findings illustrate that PB may be associated with chronic liver damage, which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences. For this reason, each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of PB-related asymptomatic chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Wilms' tumor 1 and Dax-1 modulate the orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 in sex-specific gene expression.;Products of steroidogenic factor 1 ( SF-1 ) and Wilms tumor 1 ( WT1 ) genes are essential for mammalian gonadogenesis prior to sexual differentiation . In males , SF-1 participates in sexual development by regulating expression of the polypeptide hormone Mullerian inhibiting substance ( MIS ) . Here , we show that WT1 -KTS isoforms associate and synergize with SF-1 to promote MIS expression . In contrast , WT1 missense mutations , associated with male pseudohermaphroditism in Denys-Drash syndrome , fail to synergize with SF-1 . Additionally , the X-linked , candidate dosage-sensitive sex-reversal gene , Dax-1 , antagonizes synergy between SF-1 and WT1 , most likely through a direct interaction with SF-1 . We propose that WT1 and Dax-1 functionally oppose each other in testis development by modulating SF-1-mediated transactivation . .;neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']

Subjective assessment of sexual dysfunction of patients on long-term administration of digoxin.;Various data suggest that male patients who have received digoxin on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH). This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long-term administration of digoxin therapy and sexual behavior, and the effect of digoxin on plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and LH. The patients of the study and control group (without digoxin) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age (25-40 years) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patients. A subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out, using parameters such as sexual desire, sexual excitement, and frequency of sexual relations. Personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior. The findings support the reports concerning digoxin effect on plasma estradiol, testosterone, and LH. The differences in the means were significant. Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant decrease in sexual desire, sexual excitement phase (erection), and frequency of sexual relations in the study group.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']

Ethambutol and optic neuropathy.;PURPOSE: To demonstrate the association between ethambutol and optic neuropathy. METHOD: Thirteen patients who developed optic neuropathy after being treated with ethambutol for tuberculosis of the lung or lymph node at Siriraj Hospital between 1997 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics and initial and final visual acuity were analyzed to determine visual outcome. RESULTS: All patients had optic neuropathy between 1 to 6 months (mean = 2.9 months) after starting ethambutol therapy at a dosage ranging from 13 to 20 mg/kg/day (mean = 17 mg/kg/day). Seven (54%) of the 13 patients experienced visual recovery after stopping the drug. Of 6 patients with irreversible visual impairment, 4 patients had diabetes mellitus, glaucoma and a history of heavy smoking. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of optic neuropathy should be considered in patients with ethambutol therapy.

Antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of birth defects: National Birth Defects Prevention Study.;"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between antibacterial medications and selected birth defects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based, multisite, case-control study of women who had pregnancies affected by 1 of more than 30 eligible major birth defects identified via birth defect surveillance programs in 10 states (n = 13 155) and control women randomly selected from the same geographical regions (n = 4941). MAIN EXPOSURE: Reported maternal use of antibacterials (1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Odds ratios (ORs) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected birth defects adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy, peaking during the third month. Sulfonamides were associated with anencephaly (adjusted OR [AOR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.8), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.6), coarctation of the aorta (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6), choanal atresia (AOR = 8.0; 95% CI, 2.7-23.5), transverse limb deficiency (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-5.9), and diaphragmatic hernia (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.4). Nitrofurantoins were associated with anophthalmia or microphthalmos (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.9-9.1), atrial septal defects (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), and cleft lip with cleft palate (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9). Other antibacterial agents that showed associations included erythromycins (2 defects), penicillins (1 defect), cephalosporins (1 defect), and quinolones (1 defect). CONCLUSIONS: Reassuringly, penicillins, erythromycins, and cephalosporins, although used commonly by pregnant women, were not associated with many birth defects. Sulfonamides and nitrofurantoins were associated with several birth defects, indicating a need for additional scrutiny.";neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']
Cardiovascular risk with cyclooxygenase inhibitors: general problem with substance specific differences?;Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']

Rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated Iranian patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection.;BACKGROUND: Lamivudine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients. Recent studies show that the YMDD motif mutants (resistant hepatitis B virus) occur as natural genome variability in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients. In this study we aimed to determine the rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients in Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 77 chronic hepatitis B patients who had not been treated with lamivudine were included in the study. Serum samples from patients were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for detection of YMDD motif mutants. All patients were also tested for liver enzymes, anti-HCV, HBeAg, and anti-HBe. RESULTS: Of the 77 patients enrolled in the study, 73% were male and 27% were female. Mean ALT and AST levels were 124.4+/-73.4 and 103.1+/-81 IU/l, respectively. HBeAg was positive in 40% and anti-HBe in 60% of the patients. Anti-HCV was negative in all of them. YMDD motif mutants were not detected in any of the patients despite the liver enzyme levels and the presence of HBeAg or anti-HBe. CONCLUSION: Although the natural occurrence of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated patients with chronic hepatitis B has been reported, these mutants were not detected in Iranian lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Association of BRCA1 with the hRad50-hMre11-p95 complex and the DNA damage response.;BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers . Here , it is shown that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with hRad50 , which forms a complex with hMre11 and p95 / nibrin . Upon irradiation , BRCA1 was detected in discrete foci in the nucleus , which colocalize with hRad50 . Formation of irradiation-induced foci positive for BRCA1 , hRad50 , hMre11 , or p95 was dramatically reduced in HCC / 1937 breast cancer cells carrying a homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of wild-type BRCA1 . Ectopic expression of wild-type , but not mutated , BRCA1 in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent , methyl methanesulfonate .

Uncoupling of hypomyelination and glial cell death by a mutation in the proteolipid protein gene.;"Proteolipid protein ( PLP ; M ( r ) 30 , 000 ) is a highly conserved major polytopic membrane protein in myelin but its cellular function remains obscure . Neurological mutant mice can often provide model systems for human genetic disorders . Mutations of the X-chromosome-linked PLP gene are lethal , identified first in the jimpy mouse and subsequently in patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease . The unexplained phenotype of these mutations includes degeneration and premature cell death of oligodendrocytes with associated hypomyelination . Here we show that a new mouse mutant rumpshaker is defined by the amino-acid substitution Ile-to-Thr at residue 186 in a membrane-embedded domain of PLP . Surprisingly , rumpshaker mice , although myelin-deficient , have normal longevity and a full complement of morphologically normal oligodendrocytes . Hypomyelination can thus be genetically separated from the PLP-dependent oligodendrocyte degeneration . We suggest that PLP has a vital function in glial cell development , distinct from its later role in myelin assembly , and that this dichotomy of action may explain the clinical spectrum of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease . .";neurological;['neurological']

Dual roles of ATM in the cellular response to radiation and in cell growth control.;The gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) patients , denoted ATM , encodes a putative protein or lipid kinase . To elucidate the functions of ATM , we disrupted the mouse ATM gene through homologous recombination in mice . Consistent with cellular defects of AT patients , the ATM- / - cells are hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation and defective in cell-cycle arrest following radiation , correlating with a defective up-regulation of p53 . In addition , ATM- / - mouse thymocytes are more resistant to apoptosis induced by gamma-irradiation than normal thymocytes . ATM- / - fibroblasts are inefficient in G1 to S-phase progression following serum stimulation and senesce after only a few passages in culture . They have an increased constitutive level of p21CP1 / WAF1 . The ATM protein is therefore critical both for cellular responses to ionizing radiation and for normal cell-cycle progression . ATM + / - fibroblasts and thymocytes showed intermediately defective responses to irradiation but no growth defect , suggesting that the increased cancer risk of AT heterozygotes could be attributable to poor checkpoint function . .;neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']

Flestolol: an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent.;Flestolol (ACC-9089) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes. This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min. In long-term infusion studies, flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days. Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta-adrenergic blockade. Flestolol produced a dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers. In contrast with other beta blockers, flestolol-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life. Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. In patients with unstable angina, flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain. It is concluded that flestolol is a potent, well-tolerated, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Use of flestolol in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation.;neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']
Blood pressure response to chronic low-dose intrarenal noradrenaline infusion in conscious rats.;Sodium chloride solution (0.9%) or noradrenaline in doses of 4, 12 and 36 micrograms h-1 kg-1 was infused for five consecutive days, either intrarenally (by a new technique) or intravenously into rats with one kidney removed. Intrarenal infusion of noradrenaline caused hypertension at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously. Intrarenal compared with intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused higher plasma noradrenaline concentrations and a shift of the plasma noradrenaline concentration-blood pressure effect curve towards lower plasma noradrenaline levels. These results suggest that hypertension after chronic intrarenal noradrenaline infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating noradrenaline and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']

Role of mangiferin on biochemical alterations and antioxidant status in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.;The current study dealt with the protective role of mangiferin, a polyphenol from Mangifera indica Linn. (Anacardiaceae), on isoproterenol (ISPH)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats through its antioxidative mechanism. Subcutaneous injection of ISPH (200 mg/kg body weight in 1 ml saline) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused myocardial damage in rat heart, which was determined by the increased activity of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), increased uric acid level and reduced plasma iron binding capacity. The protective role of mangiferin was analyzed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the ischemic myocardium. The heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase activities, non-enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and glutathione levels were altered in MI rats. Upon pretreatment with mangiferin (100 mg/kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide) given intraperitoneally for 28 days to MI rats protected the above-mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels. Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non-enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon mangiferin administration as compared to ISPH-induced MI rats. From the present study it is concluded that mangiferin exerts a beneficial effect against ISPH-induced MI due to its antioxidant potential, which regulated the tissues defense system against cardiac damage.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']

Late fulminant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant.;OBJECTIVES: Posterior leukoencephalopathy due to calcineurin-inhibitor-related neurotoxicity is a rare but severe complication that results from treatment with immunosuppressive agents (primarily those administered after a liver or kidney transplant). The pathophysiologic mechanisms of that disorder remain unknown. CASE: We report the case of a 46-year-old woman who received a liver transplant in our center as treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis and in whom either a fulminant course of posterior leukoencephalopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome developed 110 days after transplant. After an initially uneventful course after the transplant, the patient rapidly fell into deep coma. RESULTS: Cerebral MRI scan showed typical signs of enhancement in the pontine and posterior regions. Switching the immunosuppressive regimen from tacrolimus to cyclosporine did not improve the clinical situation. The termination of treatment with any calcineurin inhibitor resulted in a complete resolution of that complication. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant is rare. We recommend a complete cessation of any calcineurin inhibitor rather than a dose reduction.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Frequent inactivation of PTEN/MMAC1 in primary prostate cancer.;Sporadic prostate carcinoma is the most common male cancer in the Western world , yet many of the major genetic events involved in the progression of this often fatal cancer remain to be elucidated . Numerous cytogenetic and allelotype studies have reported frequent loss of heterozygosity on chromosomal arm 10q in sporadic prostate cancer . Deletion mapping studies have unambiguously identified a region of chromosome 10q23 to be the minimal area of loss . A new tumor suppressor gene , PTEN / MMAC1 , was isolated recently at this region of chromosome 10q23 and found to be inactivated by mutation in three prostate cancer cell lines . We screened 80 prostate tumors by microsatellite analysis and found chromosome 10q23 to be deleted in 23 cases . We then proceeded with sequence analysis of the entire PTEN / MMAC1 coding region and tested for homozygous deletion with new intragenic markers in these 23 cases with 10q23 loss of heterozygosity . The identification of the second mutational event in 10 ( 43 % ) tumors establishes PTEN / MMAC1 as a main inactivation target of 10q loss in sporadic prostate cancer . .;oncological;['oncological']
The natural history of Vigabatrin associated visual field defects in patients electing to continue their medication.;"PURPOSE: To determine the natural history of visual field defects in a group of patients known to have Vigabatrin-associated changes who elected to continue the medication because of good seizure control. METHODS: All patients taking Vigabatrin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs for at least 5 years (range 5-12 years) were entered into a visual surveillance programme. Patients were followed up at 6-monthly intervals for not less than 18 months (range 18-43 months). In all, 16 patients with unequivocal defects continued the medication. Following already published methodology (Eye 2002; 16;567-571) monocular mean radial degrees (MRDs) to the I/4e isopter on Goldmann perimetry was calculated for the right eye at the time of discovery of a visual field defect and again after not less than 18 months follow-up. RESULTS: Mean right eye MRD at presentation was 36.98 degrees (range 22.25-51.0), compared to 38.40 degrees (range 22.5-49.75) after follow-up; P=0.338 unpaired t-test. Only one patient demonstrated a deterioration in visual field during the study period and discontinued treatment. CONCLUSION: Established visual field defects presumed to be due to Vigabatrin therapy did not usually progress in spite of continuing use of the medication. These data give support to the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of Vigabatrin-associated visual field defects may be an idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction rather than dose-dependent toxicity.";neurological;['neurological']

Tight linkage between myotonic dystrophy and apolipoprotein E genes revealed with allele-specific oligonucleotides.;In 16 families with myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) a novel approach based on use of allele-specific oligonucleotides has been employed to study the linkage relationship between the apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) gene and DM . Synthetic oligonucleotides , designed to discriminate between APOE alleles epsilon 3 and epsilon 4 , enabled us to distinguish heterozygous carriers in a hybridization assay . In a subset of families , the relevant segment of the APOE gene was enzymatically amplified to increase the sensitivity of the method . For DM and APOE , a maximum lod score ( zmax of 7 . 47 was obtained at a recombination frequency ( theta ) of 0 . 047 ( male theta = female theta ) . No recombination ( maximum lod score of 5 . 61 at theta = 0 . 0 ) was found between APOE and the apolipoprotein CII ( APOC2 ) gene . These results suggest that , in addition to APOC2 , APOE is a useful marker for presymptomatic DM diagnosis .;neurological;['neurological']

Patterns of hepatic injury induced by methyldopa.;Twelve patients with liver disease related to methyldopa were seen between 1967 and 1977. Illness occurred within 1--9 weeks of commencement of therapy in 9 patients, the remaining 3 patients having received the drug for 13 months, 15 months and 7 years before experiencing symptoms. Jaundice with tender hepatomegaly, usually preceded by symptoms of malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and associated with upper abdominal pain, was an invariable finding in all patients. Biochemical liver function tests indicated hepatocellular necrosis and correlated with histopathological evidence of hepatic injury, the spectrum of which ranged from fatty change and focal hepatocellular necrosis to massive hepatic necrosis. Most patients showed moderate to severe acute hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis with associated cholestasis. The drug was withdrawn on presentation to hospital in 11 patients, with rapid clinical improvement in 9. One patient died, having presented in hepatic failure, and another, who had been taking methyldopa for 7 years, showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months. The remaining patient in the series developed fulminant hepatitis when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of methyldopa-induced hepatitis. In this latter patient, and in 2 others, the causal relationship between methyldopa and hepatic dysfunction was proved with the recurrence of hepatitis within 2 weeks of re-exposure to the drug.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

A mouse model for Prader-Willi syndrome imprinting-centre mutations.;Imprinting in the 15q11-q13 region involves an imprinting centre ( IC ) , mapping in part to the promoter and first exon of SNRPN . Deletion of this IC abolishes local paternally derived gene expression and results in Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) . We have created two deletion mutations in mice to understand PWS and the mechanism of this IC . Mice harbouring an intragenic deletion in Snrpn are phenotypically normal , suggesting that mutations of SNRPN are not sufficient to induce PWS . Mice with a larger deletion involving both Snrpn and the putative PWS-IC lack expression of the imprinted genes Zfp127 ( mouse homologue of ZNF127 ) , Ndn and Ipw , and manifest several phenotypes common to PWS infants . These data demonstrate that both the position of the IC and its role in the coordinate expression of genes is conserved between mouse and human , and indicate that the mouse is a suitable model system in which to investigate the molecular mechanisms of imprinting in this region of the genome . .;neurological;['neurological']

The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product interacts with Sp1 to repress vascular endothelial growth factor promoter activity.;The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene ( VHL ) has a critical role in the pathogenesis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , as VHL mutations have been found in both von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated and sporadic RCCs . Recent studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) mRNA is upregulated in RCC- and von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors . We have therefore assessed the effect of the VHL gene product on VEGF expression . VEGF promoter-luciferase constructs were transiently cotransfected with a wild-type VHL ( wt-VHL ) vector in several cell lines , including 293 embryonic kidney and RCC cell lines . wt-VHL protein inhibited VEGF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 5- to 10-fold . Deletion analysis defined a 144-bp region of the VEGF promoter necessary for VHL repression . This VHL-responsive element is GC rich and specifically binds the transcription factor Sp1 in crude nuclear extracts . In Drosophila cells , cotransfected VHL represses Sp1-mediated activation but not basal activity of the VEGF promoter . We next demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitates that VHL and Sp1 were part of the same complex and , by using a glutathione-S-transferase-VHL fusion protein and purified Sp1 , that VHL and Sp1 directly interact . Furthermore , endogenous VEGF mRNA levels were suppressed in permanent RCC cell lines expressing wt-VHL , and nuclear run-on studies indicated that VHL regulation of VEGF occurs at least partly at the transcriptional level . These observations support a new mechanism for VHL-mediated transcriptional repression via a direct inhibitory action on Sp1 and suggest that loss of Sp1 inhibition may be important in the pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease and RCC . .;hepatorenal|oncological;['hepatorenal', 'oncological']

Effects of verapamil on atrial fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs.;BACKGROUND: Atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF) and decreases L-type Ca(2+) current. There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type Ca(2) channel blockade can promote AF, consistent with an AF promoting effect of Ca(2+) channel inhibition. METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca(2+) channel blockers, we administered verapamil to morphine-chloralose anesthetized dogs. Diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and nadolol was applied in some experiments. Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during AF. RESULTS: Verapamil caused AF promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil. In these experiments, verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005). Diltiazem did not affect ERP, AF cycle length or AF duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil (n=5). In the presence of autonomic blockade, verapamil failed to promote AF and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness. Neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade. Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil promotes AF in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem.;neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']
Two distinct mutations at a single BamHI site in phenylketonuria.;Classical phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . The abolition of an invariant BamHI site located in the coding sequence of the PAH gene ( exon 7 ) led to the recognition of two new point mutations at codon 272 and 273 ( 272gly----stop and 273ser----phe , respectively ) . Both mutations were detected in north eastern France or Belgium and occurred on the background of RFLP haplotype 7 alleles . The present study supports the view that the clinical heterogeneity in PKU is accounted for by the large variety of mutant genotypes associated with PAH deficiencies . .;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked congenital thrombocytopenia are caused by mutations of the same gene.;The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia , small platelets , eczema , recurrent infections , and immunodeficiency . Besides the classic WAS phenotype , there is a group of patients with congenital X-linked thrombocytopenia ( XLT ) who have small platelets but only transient eczema , if any , and minimal immune deficiency . Because the gene responsible for WAS has been sequenced , it was possible to correlate the WAS phenotypes with WAS gene mutations . Using a fingerprinting screening technique , we determined the approximate location of the mutation in 13 unrelated WAS patients with mild to severe clinical symptoms . Direct sequence analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA obtained from patient-derived cell lines showed 12 unique mutations distributed throughout the WAS gene , including insertions , deletions , and point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions , termination , exon skipping , or splicing defects . Of 4 unrelated patients with the XLT phenotype , 3 had missense mutations affecting exon 2 and 1 had a splice-site mutation affecting exon 9 . Patients with classic WAS had more complex mutations , resulting in termination codons , frameshift , and early termination . These findings provide direct evidence that XLT and WAS are caused by mutations of the same gene and suggest that severe clinical phenotypes are associated with complex mutations . .;neurological;['neurological']

Safety and adverse effects associated with raloxifene: multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation.;"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of raloxifene on major adverse events that occur with postmenopausal estrogen therapy or tamoxifen. METHODS: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Women were randomly assigned to raloxifene 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d or placebo. Outcomes included venous thromboembolism, cataracts, gallbladder disease, and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (relative risk [RR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.8). The excess event rate was 1.8 per 1,000 woman-years (95% CI -0.5-4.1), and the number needed to treat to cause 1 event was 170 (95% CI 100-582) over 3.3 years. Risk in the raloxifene group was higher than in the placebo group for the first 2 years, but decreased to about the same rate as in the placebo group thereafter. Raloxifene did not increase risk for cataracts (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.1), gallbladder disease (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.7-1.3), endometrial hyperplasia (RR 1.3; 95% CI 0.4-5.1), or endometrial cancer (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.3-2.7).

Pharmacokinetics of desipramine HCl when administered with cinacalcet HCl.;OBJECTIVE: In vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 2D6. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity, using desipramine as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects. METHODS: Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine (50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet (90 mg for 7 days). Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose. RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms. Relative to desipramine alone, mean AUC and C(max) of desipramine increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with cinacalcet. The t (1/2,z) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet (21.0 versus 43.3 hs). The t (max) was similar between the regimens. Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6.

An unexpected diagnosis in a renal-transplant patient with proteinuria treated with everolimus: AL amyloidosis.;Proteinuria is an expected complication in transplant patients treated with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-i). However, clinical suspicion should always be supported by histological evidence in order to investigate potential alternate diagnoses such as acute or chronic rejection, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, or recurrent or de novo glomerulopathy. In this case we report the unexpected diagnosis of amyloidosis in a renal-transplant patient with pre-transplant monoclonal gammapathy of undetermined significance who developed proteinuria after conversion from tacrolimus to everolimus.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']
Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy-induced inflammation and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B1 receptor.;Clinical use of the anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by its cardiotoxic effects, which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis. To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) during the development of DOX cardiomyopathy, we studied B1R knockout mice (B1R(-/-)) by investigating cardiac inflammation and apoptosis after induction of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. DOX control mice showed cardiac dysfunction measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo. This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT, as well as an increased bax/bcl2 ratio in Western blots, indicating cardiac apoptosis. Furthermore, mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue. In DOX B1R(-/-) mice, cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state. These findings suggest that B1R is detrimental in DOX cardiomyopathy in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis. These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B1R antagonists for treatment of human DOX cardiomyopathy.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']

Antitumor effect, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity of doxorubicin in the IgM solid immunocytoma-bearing LOU/M/WSL rat.;Antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity induced by doxorubicin were studied in LOU/M/WSL inbred rats each bearing a transplantable solid IgM immunocytoma. Animals with a tumor (diameter, 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm) were treated with iv injections of doxorubicin on 5 consecutive days, followed by 1 weekly injection for 7 weeks (dose range, 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body wt). Tumor regression was observed with 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg. Complete disappearance of the tumor was induced with 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Histologic evidence of cardiotoxicity scored as grade III was only observed at a dose of 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Light microscopic evidence of renal damage was seen above a dose of 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg, which resulted in albuminuria and very low serum albumin levels. In the group that received 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg, the serum albumin level decreased from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter. Ascites and hydrothorax were observed simultaneously. The same experiments were performed with non-tumor-bearing rats, in which no major differences were observed. In conclusion, antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were studied simultaneously in the same LOU/M/WSL rat. Albuminuria due to renal damage led to extremely low serum albumin levels, so ascites and hydrothorax were not necessarily a consequence of the observed cardiomyopathy.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological;['cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal', 'oncological']
The exon 13 duplication in the BRCA1 gene is a founder mutation present in geographically diverse populations.;The BRCA1 Exon 13 Duplication Screening Group. Recently , a 6-kb duplication of exon 13 , which creates a frameshift in the coding sequence of the BRCA1 gene , has been described in three unrelated U . S S . families of European ancestry and in one Portuguese family . Here , our goal was to estimate the frequency and geographic diversity of carriers of this duplication . To do this , a collaborative screening study was set up that involved 39 institutions from 19 countries and included 3 , 580 unrelated individuals with a family history of the disease and 934 early-onset breast and / or ovarian cancer cases . A total of 11 additional families carrying this mutation were identified in Australia ( 1 ) , Belgium ( 1 ) , Canada ( 1 ) , Great Britain ( 6 ) , and the United States ( 2 ) . Haplotyping showed that they are likely to derive from a common ancestor , possibly of northern British origin . Our results demonstrate that it is strongly advisable , for laboratories carrying out screening either in English-speaking countries or in countries with historical links with Britain , to include within their BRCA1 screening protocols the polymerase chain reaction-based assay described in this report .;oncological;['oncological']

Lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy after steroid injection at lateral epicondyle.;"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This report aimed to present a case of lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy (LACNP) that occurred after a steroid injection in the lateral epicondyle to treat lateral epicondylitis in a 40-year-old woman. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A 40-year-old woman presented with decreased sensation and paresthesia over her right lateral forearm; the paresthesia had occurred after a steroid injection in the right lateral epicondyle 3 months before. Her sensation of light touch and pain was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area. RESULTS: The sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) (6.2 uV) was lower than that of the left (13.1 uV). The difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50% reduction. She was diagnosed with right LACNP (mainly axonal involvement) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings. Her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree. CONCLUSION: This report describes the case of a woman with LACNP that developed after a steroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. An electrodiagnostic study, including a nerve conduction study of the LACN, was helpful to diagnose right LACNP and to find the passage of the LACN on the lateral epicondyle.";neurological;['neurological']
Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin-induced renal damage.;"BACKGROUND: In man, differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, related to ACE (I/D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis. This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats. METHODS: Renal ACE activity (Hip-His-Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested. RESULTS: As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.22, NS). In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed. CONCLUSION: Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin-induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain. This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage.";hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Potential therapeutic use of the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist, A-86929: an acute study in parkinsonian levodopa-primed monkeys.;The clinical utility of dopamine (DA) D1 receptor agonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unclear. The therapeutic use of selective DA D1 receptor agonists such as SKF-82958 (6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzaze pine hydrobromide) and A-77636 ([1R, 3S] 3-[1'-admantyl]-1-aminomethyl-3,4-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1H-2-benzo pyran hydrochloride) seems limited because of their duration of action, which is too short for SKF-82958 (< 1 hr) and too long for A-77636 (> 20 hr, leading to behavioral tolerance). We therefore conducted the present acute dose-response study in four 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit levodopa-induced dyskinesias to evaluate the locomotor and dyskinetic effects on challenge with four doses (from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg) of A-86929 ([-]-[5aR,11bS]-4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-2-propyl-3-thia-5-+ ++azacyclopent-1- ena[c]phenathrene-9-10-diol), a selective and full DA D1-like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action. Levodopa and the DA D2-like receptor agonist, LY-171555 ([4aR-trans]-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-o-dihydro-5n-propyl-2H-pyrazo lo-3-4-quinoline hydrochloride) were also used for comparison. Acute administration of A-86929 was as efficacious in alleviating MPTP-induced parkinsonism as levodopa and LY-171555, but was less likely to reproduce the levodopa-induced dyskinesias in these animals than with either LY-171555 or subsequent challenge of levodopa. Selective stimulation of the DA D1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (referred to as the basal ganglia output) compared with levodopa and selective DA D2 receptor agonist. Potent DA D1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as A-86929 (approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested) are potential therapeutic tools in PD and merit further attention.;neurological;['neurological']
Succimer chelation improves learning, attention, and arousal regulation in lead-exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure.;BACKGROUND: There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels. However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning. RESULTS: Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb-exposed children. Succimer treatment of the Pb-exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit. In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure. These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children. However, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals.;neurological;['neurological']

The 3-week sulphasalazine syndrome strikes again.;"A 34-year-old lady developed a constellation of dermatitis, fever, lymphadenopathy and hepatitis, beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral sulphasalazine for sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis. Cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis, associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates, without viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of an adverse drug reaction.A week later, fulminant drug-induced hepatitis, associated with the presence of anti-nuclear autoantibodies (but not with other markers of autoimmunity), and accompanied by multi-organ failure and sepsis, supervened. She subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy.Post-mortem examination showed evidence of massive hepatocellular necrosis, acute hypersensitivity myocarditis, focal acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis and extensive bone marrow necrosis, with no evidence of malignancy. It is thought that the clinico-pathological features and chronology of this case bore the hallmarks of the so-called ""3-week sulphasalazine syndrome"", a rare, but often fatal, immunoallergic reaction to sulphasalazine.";hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent corticosterone treatment in rats.;The development of schizophrenia may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events, in combination leading to overt disease. We investigated the effect of an early stress, in the form of maternal deprivation, combined with a later stress, simulated by chronic periadolescent corticosterone treatment, on behaviour in rats. Acute treatment with apomorphine caused disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or corticosterone treatment, but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress. Amphetamine treatment significantly disrupted PPI in both non-deprived groups, but was absent in both maternally deprived groups. The serotonin-1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, induced a significant disruption of PPI in all groups. Amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity was similar in all groups. These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress, caused by maternal deprivation, combined with 'adolescent' stress, simulated by corticosterone treatment, on dopaminergic regulation of PPI. The altered effects of apomorphine and amphetamine could indicate differential changes in dopamine receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation, or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus.;neurological;['neurological']
Chronic carbamazepine inhibits the development of local anesthetic seizures kindled by cocaine and lidocaine.;The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment on local anesthetic-kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of CBZ administration. Chronic oral CBZ inhibited the development of both lidocaine- and cocaine-induced seizures, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures. Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure-related mortality in the cocaine-injected rats. Acute CBZ over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed lidocaine-kindled or acute cocaine-induced seizures. Repeated i.p. injection of CBZ (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine- or cocaine-kindled seizures. The differential effects of CBZ depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic-kindled seizures. The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated, intermittent injections of CBZ suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens. The possible utility of chronic CBZ in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data, but remains to be directly evaluated.;neurological;['neurological']
Prophylactic use of lamivudine with chronic immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatologic disorders.;The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of lamivudine in hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBs Ag) positive patients with rheumatologic disease. From June 2004 to October 2006, 11 HBs Ag positive patients with rheumatologic diseases, who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic lamivudine therapies, were retrospectively assessed. Liver function tests, hepatitis B virus (HBV) serologic markers, and HBV DNA levels of the patients during follow-up were obtained from hospital file records. Eleven patients (six male) with median age 47 years (range 27-73), median disease duration 50 months (range 9-178) and median follow-up period of patients 13.8 months (range 5-27) were enrolled in this study. Lamivudine therapy was started 3-7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients. Baseline, liver function tests were elevated in two patients (fourth patient: ALT:122 IU/l, AST:111 IU/l, tenth patient:ALT:294 IU/l, AST:274 IU/l, with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both). Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow-up period none of the patients had abnormal liver function tests. In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline. Two of these normalized and the others increased later. In three additional patients, HBV DNA levels were increased during follow-up. None of the patients had significant clinical sings of HBV activation. Lamivudine was well tolerated and was continued in all patients. Prophylactic administration of lamivudine in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe, well tolerated and effective in preventing HBV reactivation.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Pallidal stimulation: an alternative to pallidotomy?;"A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985. Laitinen's procedure improved most symptoms in drug-resistant PD, which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community. Another lesioning procedure, ventrolateral thalamotomy, has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius, producing high long-term success rates and low morbidity rates. Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success. According to the literature pallidotomy improves the ""on"" symptoms of PD, such as dyskinesias, as well as the ""off"" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on-off fluctuations. Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper- or dyskinetic upper limbs, but increases the ""freezing"" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time. Considering the small increase in the patient's independence, the high costs of bilateral implants, and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices, the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy.";neurological;['neurological']

Basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychological distress in recreational ecstasy polydrug users.;RATIONALE: Ecstasy (MDMA) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with psychobiological dysfunction. While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long-term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users. OBJECTIVES: The current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period. METHOD: Seventy-six participants (21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy-polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy-polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling (on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime). On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor. RESULTS: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers. On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed. On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users. Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day. CONCLUSIONS: The increases in anxiety and depression are in line with previous observations in recreational ecstasy-polydrug users. Dysregulated diurnal cortisol may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of ecstasy.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Effect of nondopaminergic drugs on L-dopa-induced dyskinesias in MPTP-treated monkeys.;A group of four monkeys was rendered parkinsonian with the toxin MPTP. They were then treated chronically with L-DOPA/benserazide 50/12.5 mg/kg given orally daily for 2 months. This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect, but all animals manifested dyskinesia. A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L-DOPA to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified. Several drugs, including clonidine, physostigmine, methysergide, 5-MDOT, propranolol, and MK-801, markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology. However, yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements. Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia. Atropine converted the dystonic movements into chorea.;neurological;['neurological']

Oxidative stress on cardiotoxicity after treatment with single and multiple doses of doxorubicin.;The mechanism of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity remains controversial. Wistar rats (n = 66) received DOX injections intraperitoneally and were randomly assigned to 2 experimental protocols: (1) rats were killed before (-24 h, n = 8) and 24 h after (+24 h, n = 8) a single dose of DOX (4 mg/kg body weight) to determine the DOX acute effect and (2) rats (n = 58) received 4 injections of DOX (4 mg/kg body weight/week) and were killed before the first injection (M0) and 1 week after each injection (M1, M2, M3, and M4) to determine the chronological effects. Animals used at M0 (n = 8) were also used at moment -24 h of acute study. Cardiac total antioxidant performance (TAP), DNA damage, and morphology analyses were carried out at each time point. Single dose of DOX was associated with increased cardiac disarrangement, necrosis, and DNA damage (strand breaks (SBs) and oxidized pyrimidines) and decreased TAP. The chronological study showed an effect of a cumulative dose on body weight (R = -0.99, p = 0.011), necrosis (R = 1.00, p = 0.004), TAP (R = 0.95, p = 0.049), and DNA SBs (R = -0.95, p = 0.049). DNA SBs damage was negatively associated with TAP (R = -0.98, p = 0.018), and necrosis (R = -0.97, p = 0.027). Our results suggest that oxidative damage is associated with acute cardiotoxicity induced by a single dose of DOX only. Increased resistance to the oxidative stress is plausible for the multiple dose of DOX. Thus, different mechanisms may be involved in acute toxicity versus chronic toxicity.;neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']
Inappropriate use of carbamazepine and vigabatrin in typical absence seizures.;Carbamazepine and vigabatrin are contraindicated in typical absence seizures. Of 18 consecutive referrals of children with resistant typical absences only, eight were erroneously treated with carbamazepine either as monotherapy or as an add-on. Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children. Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of these developed myoclonic jerks, which resolved on withdrawal of carbamazepine. Absences were aggravated in both cases where vigabatrin was added on to concurrent treatment. Optimal control of the absences was achieved with sodium valproate, lamotrigine, or ethosuximide alone or in combination.;neurological;['neurological']

Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy: correlation of phenotype by electroretinography with sites of dystrophin mutations.;The dark-adapted electroretinogram ( ERG ) of patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy ( DMD / BMD ) shows a marked reduction in b-wave amplitude . Genotype-phenotype studies of mouse models for DMD show position-specific effects of the mutations upon the phenotype  mice with 5 defects of dystrophin have normal ERGs , those with defects in the central region have a normal b-wave amplitude associated with prolonged implicit times for both the b-wave and oscillatory potentials , and mice with 3 defects have a phenotype similar to that seen in  DMD / BMD patients . The mouse studies suggest a key role for the carboxyl terminal dystrophin isoform , Dp260 , in retinal electrophysiology . We have undertaken a systematic evaluation of DMD / BMD patients through clinical examination and review of the literature in order to determine whether the position-specific effects of mutations noted in the mouse are present in man . We have found that , in man , a wider variation of DMD defects correlate with reductions in the b-wave amplitude . Individuals with normal ERGs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of Dp260 . Our results suggest that the most important determinant in the ERG b-wave phenotype is the mutation position , rather than muscle disease severity . Forty-six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the Dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ERGs , as opposed to 94 % with more distal mutations . The human genotype-phenotype correlations are consistent with a role for Dp260 in normal retinal electrophysiology and may also reflect the expression of other C-terminal dystrophin isoforms and their contributions to retinal signal transmission . .;neurological;['neurological']

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with risperidone.;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is thought to be a result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia. Risperidone, a benzisoxazole derivative antipsychotic, has high serotonin 5-HT2 receptor blockade and dose-related D2 receptor blockade. The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone at low dosages. With this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms, it was thought the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome might also be lowered. A 73-year-old woman developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after monotherapy with risperidone. The syndrome reversed after discontinuing risperidone and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine. It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with risperidone does not ensure protection from neuroleptic malignant syndrome.;neurological;['neurological']

Upregulation of brain expression of P-glycoprotein in MRP2-deficient TR(-) rats resembles seizure-induced up-regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats.;PURPOSE: The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). MRP2 is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent Wistar rats. By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB. However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur. This prompted us to study the brain expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) Wistar rats. METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR(-) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR(-) rats. TR(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls. No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections. A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR(-) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB. CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR(-) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB. Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB. Furthermore, our data suggest that TR(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp-enhancing events for this purpose.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced Parkinson's disease.;"BACKGROUND: Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short-term follow-up. METHODS: Forty patients with Parkinson's disease underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal (""off"" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens (""on"" period). All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years. RESULTS: The percent improvements at six months were as follows: off-period score for overall motor function, 28 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off-period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on-period score for contralateral dyskinesias, 82 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on-period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias, 44 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent). The improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off-period parkinsonism, contralateral bradykinesia, and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years. The improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months. Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery. The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication. CONCLUSIONS: In late-stage Parkinson's disease, pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias and off-period disability. Much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year. The on-period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy.";neurological;['neurological']
Hyperalgesia and myoclonus in terminal cancer patients treated with continuous intravenous morphine.;Eight cancer patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous morphine developed hyperalgesia. All cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in Copenhagen. Five patients developed universal hyperalgesia and hyperesthesia which in 2 cases were accompanied by myoclonus. In 3 patients a pre-existing neuralgia increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases myoclonus occurred simultaneously. Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between hyperalgesia/myoclonus and high doses of morphine are available, experimental support from animal studies indicates that morphine, or its metabolites, plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome. The possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations.;neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']

Deletions of a DNA sequence in retinoblastomas and mesenchymal tumors: organization of the sequence and its encoded protein.;Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumor that can arise because of mutant alleles acquired as somatic or germinal mutations . The mutant allele can be carried in the germ line . The mutations creating these alleles act by inactivating copies of a recessive oncogene located within band q14 of chromosome 13 and termed the RB1 locus . We have reported isolation of a cDNA fragment that recognizes chromosomal sequences possessing many of the attributes of the retinoblastoma gene associated with the RB1 locus . We now report that this segment is additionally the target of somatic mutations in mesenchymal tumors among patients having no apparent predisposition to retinoblastoma and no previous evidence of retinoblastoma . These tumors provide additional evidence that the cloned sequences are representative of a gene that is a frequent target of inactivation during tumorigenesis . Sequence analysis of this cDNA provides little insight into its normal functional role . .;oncological;['oncological']
Insulin gene region contributes to genetic susceptibility to, but may not to low incidence of, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in Japanese.;In the Caucasian population , it has been demonstrated that the insulin gene ( INS ) region contains the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus locus ( IDDM2 ) . In the Japanese population , however , there has been no report demonstrating the contribution of IDDM2 to the pathogenesis of IDDM . We conducted an association study of IDDM in a large number of Japanese subjects with multiple polymorphisms in INS region . We found a significant association of the INS region with IDDM . Alleles positively associated with IDDM in INS region were the same as those positively-associated with IDDM in Caucasian population , although positively-associated alleles are very common ( allele frequencies > 0 . 9 ) in the Japanese general population . These data suggest that IDDM2 is involved in the genetic susceptibility to IDDM in Japanese . The high frequencies of disease-associated alleles in the general population suggest that IDDM2 locus is not responsible for the low incidence of IDDM in Japanese .;neurological;['neurological']

"Oral manifestations of ""meth mouth"": a case report.";"AIM: The aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of ""meth mouth"" and the medical risks associated with this serious condition. BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine is a very addictive, powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac dysrhythmias, hypertension, hallucinations, and violent behavior. Dental patients abusing methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene, xerostomia, rampant caries (""meth mouth""), and excessive tooth wear. Oral rehabilitation of patients using methamphetamine can be challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old Caucasian woman presented with dental pain, bad breath, and self-reported poor esthetics. A comprehensive examination including her medical history, panoramic radiograph, and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions, which is not very common for a healthy adult. She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the drug. SUMMARY: The patient's medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of ""meth mouth."" Although three different dental treatment modalities (either conventional or implant-supported) have been offered to the patient since August 2007, the patient has yet to initiate any treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This clinical case showing oral manifestations of meth mouth was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing methamphetamines. Dental practitioners also may be skeptical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients, as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification.";cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']
Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma precipitated by lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.;"A 45-year-old man, with a 10-year history of manic depression treated with lithium, was admitted with hyperosmolar, nonketotic coma. He gave a five-year history of polyuria and polydipsia, during which time urinalysis had been negative for glucose. After recovery from hyperglycaemia, he remained polyuric despite normal blood glucose concentrations; water deprivation testing indicated nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, likely to be lithium-induced. We hypothesize that when this man developed type 2 diabetes, chronic polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus was sufficient to precipitate hyperosmolar dehydration.";hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Assessment of perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention in New Hampshire delivery hospitals.;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate current performance on recommended perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention practices in New Hampshire. METHODS: Data were extracted from 2021 paired mother-infant records for the year 2000 birth cohort in New Hampshire's 25 delivery hospitals. Assessment was done on the following: prenatal screening for hepatitis B and rubella, administration of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose to all infants, administration of hepatitis B immune globulin to infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers, rubella immunity, and administration of in-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine to rubella nonimmune women. RESULTS: Prenatal screening rates for hepatitis B (98.8%) and rubella (99.4%) were high. Hepatitis B vaccine birth dose was administered to 76.2% of all infants. All infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers also received hepatitis B immune globulin. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of hepatitis B vaccination. The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 (48.5% and 67.5%, respectively) was less than any other months, whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 (88.2%) was the highest. Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of rubella nonimmunity (9.5%). In-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine administration was documented for 75.6% of nonimmune women. CONCLUSION: This study documents good compliance in New Hampshire's birthing hospitals with national guidelines for perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention and highlights potential areas for improvement.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']
Myotonia levior is a chloride channel disorder.;The group of dominant non-dystrophic myotonias , comprising disorders characterized by clinically similar forms of myogenic muscle stiffness , is genetically inhomogeneous . Dominant myotonia congenita ( Thomsens disease ) is linked to CLCN1 , the gene encoding the major muscle chloride channel , localized on chromosome 7q35 . In contrast , dominant myotonias sensitive to potassium are caused by point mutations in SCN4A on chromosome 17q , the gene for the alpha subunit of the adult skeletal muscle sodium channel . No linkage or molecular genetic data are as yet available on myotonia levior characterized by milder symptoms and later onset of myotonia than in Thomsens disease , and absence of muscle hypertrophy . We report a CLCN1 Gln-552-Arg substitution for a family with dominant inheritance previously diagnosed to have myotonia levior . Thus , this disorder appears as a variant of Thomsens disease due to mutations leading to low clinical expressivity . In addition , we report a novel Ile-290-Met CLCN1 mutation for a typical Thomsen pedigree . In another family previously diagnosed as having Thomsens disease , we unexpectedly found a CLCN1 14 bp deletion known to cause recessive myotonia , and a rare Trp-118-Gly polymorphism . .;neurological;['neurological']

ApoB protein was detected within HBL hepatocytes utilizing immunohistochemical techniques ; however , it was markedly reduced in quantity when compared with control samples . No apoB was detectable in the plasma of HBL individuals with an ELISA assay . These data are most consistent with a mutation in the coding portion of the apoB gene in HBL patients , leading to an abnormal apoB protein and apoB mRNA instability . These results are distinct from those previously noted in abetalipoproteinemia , which was characterized by an elevated level of hepatic apoB mRNA and accumulation of intracellular hepatic apoB protein . .";hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']
Evidence for a selective brain noradrenergic involvement in the locomotor stimulant effects of amphetamine in the rat.;Male rats received the noradrenaline neurotoxin DSP4 (50 mg/kg) 7 days prior to injection of D-amphetamine (10 or 40 mumol/kg i.p.). The hyperactivity induced by D-amphetamine (10 mumol/kg) was significantly reduced by DSP4 pretreatment. However, the increased rearings and the amphetamine-induced stereotypies were not blocked by pretreatment with DSP4. The reduction of amphetamine hyperactivity induced by DSP4 was blocked by pretreatment with the noradrenaline-uptake blocking agent, desipramine, which prevents the neurotoxic action of DSP4. The present results suggest a selective involvement of central noradrenergic neurones in the locomotor stimulant effect of amphetamine in the rat.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

The role of p-aminophenol in acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity: effect of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate on acetaminophen and p-aminophenol nephrotoxicity and metabolism in Fischer 344 rats.;Acetaminophen (APAP) produces proximal tubular necrosis in Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Recently, p-aminophenol (PAP), a known potent nephrotoxicant, was identified as a metabolite of APAP in F344 rats. The purpose of this study was to determine if PAP formation is a requisite step in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the effect of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP), an acylamidase inhibitor, on APAP and PAP nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determined. BNPP (1 to 8 mM) reduced APAP deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of animals with BNPP prior to APAP or PAP administration resulted in marked reduction of APAP (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity but not PAP nephrotoxicity. This result was not due to altered disposition of either APAP or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue. Rather, BNPP pretreatment reduced the fraction of APAP excreted as PAP by 64 and 75% after APAP doses of 750 and 900 mg/kg. BNPP did not alter the excretion of APAP or any of its non-deacetylated metabolites nor did BNPP alter excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg. Therefore, the BNPP-induced reduction in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of APAP deacetylation. It is concluded that PAP formation, in vivo, accounts, at least in part, for APAP-induced renal tubular necrosis.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Long-term efficacy and adverse event of nifedipine sustained-release tablets for cyclosporin A-induced hypertension in patients with psoriasis.;Thirteen psoriatic patients with hypertension during the course of cyclosporin A therapy were treated for 25 months with a calcium channel blocker, sustained-release nifedipine, to study the clinical antihypertensive effects and adverse events during treatment with both drugs. Seven of the 13 patients had exhibited a subclinical hypertensive state before cyclosporin A therapy. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these 13 patients were decreased significantly after 4 weeks of nifedipine therapy, and blood pressure was maintained within the normal range thereafter for 25 months. The adverse events during combined therapy with cyclosporin A and nifedipine included an increase in blood urea nitrogen levels in 9 of the 13 patients and development of gingival hyperplasia in 2 of the 13 patients. Our findings indicate that sustained-release nifedipine is useful for hypertensive psoriatic patients under long-term treatment with cyclosporin A, but that these patients should be monitored for gingival hyperplasia.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']
Missense mutation in the alternative splice region of the PAX6 gene in eye anomalies.;The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis , and PAX6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies , including aniridia , Peters anomaly , corneal dystrophy , congenital cataract , and foveal hypoplasia . The gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired-type DNA-binding domain . The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA-binding subdomains , the N-terminal subdomain ( NTS ) and the C-terminal subdomain ( CTS ) , which bind respective consensus DNA sequences . The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain . The insertion , into the NTS , of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA-binding ability of the CTS . Thus , exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes . We ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with Peters anomaly , congenital cataract , Axenfeldt anomaly , and / or foveal hypoplasia , which , to our knowledge , is the first mutation identified in the splice-variant region . A T-- > A transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val-- > Asp ( GTC-- > GAC ) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region . Functional analyses demonstrated that the V54D mutation slightly increased NTS binding and decreased CTS transactivation activity to almost half . .;neurological;['neurological']

Effects of aminophylline on the threshold for initiating ventricular fibrillation during respiratory failure.;"Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure. The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized. The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs. The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. During the infusion of aminophylline, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were kept within normal limits. When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation (pH 7.05 to 7.25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level. These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in respiratory failure, pharmacologic agents, particularly aminophylline, may play a significant role.";cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']

Fabry disease: identification of novel alpha-galactosidase A mutations and molecular carrier detection by use of fluorescent chemical cleavage of mismatches.;Fabry disease ( FD ) ( angiokeratoma corporis diffusum ) is an X-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by defects in the lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A gene ( GLA ) . The enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids with terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties . Clinically , affected hemizygous males have angiokeratoma , severe acroparesthesia , renal failure , and vasculopathy of the heart and brain . While demonstration of alpha-galactosidase deficiency in leukocytes is diagnostic in affected males , enzymatic detection of female carriers is often inconclusive , due to random X-chromosomal inactivation , underlining the need of molecular investigations for accurate genetic counseling . By use of chemical cleavage of mismatches adapted to fluorescence-based detection systems , we have characterized the mutations underlying alpha-Gal A deficiency in 16 individuals from six unrelated families with FD . The mutational spectrum included five missense mutations ( C202W , C223G , N224D , R301Q , and Q327K ) and one splice-site mutation [ IVS3 G ( -1 ) -- > C ] . Studies at the mRNA level showed that the latter led to altered pre-mRNA splicing with consequent alteration of the mRNA translational reading frame and generation of a premature termination codon of translation . By use of this strategy , carrier status was accurately assessed in all seven at-risk females tested , whereas enzymatic dosages failed to diagnose or exclude heterozygosity . .;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']

Additional copies of the proteolipid protein gene causing Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease arise by separate integration into the X chromosome.;The proteolipid protein gene ( PLP ) is normally present at chromosome Xq22 . Mutations and duplications of this gene are associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease ( PMD ) . Here we describe two new families in which males affected with PMD were found to have a copy of PLP on the short arm of the X chromosome , in addition to a normal copy on Xq22 . In the first family , the extra copy was first detected by the presence of heterozygosity of the AhaII dimorphism within the PLP gene . The results of FISH analysis showed an additional copy of PLP in Xp22 . 1 , although no chromosomal rearrangements could be detected by standard karyotype analysis . Another three affected males from the family had similar findings . In a second unrelated family with signs of PMD , cytogenetic analysis showed a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome . In the inv ( X ) carried by several affected family members , FISH showed PLP signals at Xp11 . 4 and Xq22 . A third family has previously been reported , in which affected members had an extra copy of the PLP gene detected at Xq26 in a chromosome with an otherwise normal banding pattern . The identification of three separate families in which PLP is duplicated at a noncontiguous site suggests that such duplications could be a relatively common but previously undetected cause of genetic disorders .;neurological;['neurological']

5 flourouracil-induced apical ballooning syndrome: a case report.;The apical ballooning syndrome (ABS) is a recently described stress-mediated acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient wall-motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular (LV) segments without obstructive epicardial coronary disease. Cardiotoxicity is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents. However, there are no reports of ABS secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic cancer. A 79-year-old woman presented with typical ischemic chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST-segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram. She underwent recent chemotherapy with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer. Echocardiography revealed a wall-motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared akinetic. Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions. The patient was stabilized with medical therapy. Four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic. Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical akinesis.

A randomized, placebo-controlled dose-comparison trial of haloperidol for psychosis and disruptive behaviors in Alzheimer's disease.;OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: In a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase A), haloperidol, 2-3 mg/day (standard dose), and haloperidol, 0.50-0.75 mg/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease. For the subsequent 6-week double-blind crossover phase (phase B), patients taking standard- or low-dose haloperidol were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard- or low-dose haloperidol. RESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard-dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low-dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation. Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose (55%-60%) than the low dose (25%-35%) and placebo (25%-30%). The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B. In phase A, extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup (20%) who developed moderate to severe signs. Low-dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2-3 mg/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs. A starting dose of 1 mg/day with gradual, upward dose titration is recommended. The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer's disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors.;neurological;['neurological']

Continuously nebulized albuterol in severe exacerbations of asthma in adults: a case-controlled study.;A retrospective, case-controlled analysis comparing patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit with severe exacerbations of asthma who received continuously nebulized albuterol (CNA) versus intermittent albuterol (INA) treatments is reported. Forty matched pairs of patients with asthma are compared. CNA was administered for a mean of 11 +/- 10 hr. The incidence of cardiac dysrhythmias was similar between groups. Symptomatic hypokalemia did not occur. CNA patients had higher heart rates during treatment, which may reflect severity of illness. The incidence of intubation was similar. We conclude that CNA and INA demonstrated similar profiles with regard to safety, morbidity, and mortality.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']
5-Fluorouracil cardiotoxicity induced by alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine.;"Cardiotoxicity is a rare complication occurring during 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment for malignancies. We herein report the case of a 70-year-old man with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, in whom a high serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) was observed. The patient, who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung, was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital; he had no cardiac history. After admission, the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day), during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng/ml. Both the precordial pain and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of 5-FU. As the precordial pain in this patient was considered to have been due to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, the administration of 5-FU was abandoned. Instead, oral administration of S-1 (a derivative of 5-FU), at 200 mg/day twice a week, was instituted, because S-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradative of 5-FU into FBAL. The serum FBAL concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng/ml, the same as the value measured on the first day of S-1 administration. Thereafter, no cardiac symptoms were observed. The patient achieved a partial response 6 months after the initiation of the S-1 treatment. The experience of this case, together with a review of the literature, suggests that FBAL is related to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity. S-1 may be administered safely to patients with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.";neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological;['neurological', 'cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal', 'oncological']

The DNA double-strand break repair gene hMRE11 is mutated in individuals with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder.;We show that hypomorphic mutations in hMRE11 , but not in ATM , are present in certain individuals with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder ( ATLD ) . The cellular features resulting from these hMRE11 mutations are similar to those seen in A-T as well as NBS and include hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation , radioresistant DNA synthesis , and abrogation of ATM-dependent events , such as the activation of Jun kinase following exposure to gamma irradiation . Although the mutant hMre11 proteins retain some ability to interact with hRad50 and Nbs1 , formation of ionizing radiation-induced hMre11 and Nbs1 foci was absent in hMRE11 mutant cells . These data demonstrate that ATM and the hMre11 / hRad50 / Nbs1 protein complex act in the same DNA damage response pathway and link hMre11 to the complex pathology of A-T . .;neurological;['neurological']

Behavioral and neurochemical studies in mice pretreated with garcinielliptone FC in pilocarpine-induced seizures.;Garcinielliptone FC (GFC) isolated from hexanic fraction seed extract of species Platonia insignis Mart. It is widely used in folk medicine to treat skin diseases in both humans and animals as well as the seed decoction has been used to treat diarrheas and inflammatory diseases. However, there is no research on GFC effects in the central nervous system of rodents. The present study aimed to evaluate the GFC effects at doses of 25, 50 or 75 mg/kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid (r-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine, aspartate and glutathione) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures. GFC produced an increased latency to first seizure, at doses 25mg/kg (20.12 + 2.20 min), 50mg/kg (20.95 + 2.21 min) or 75 mg/kg (23.43 + 1.99 min) when compared with seized mice. In addition, GABA content of mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46.90% when compared with seized mice. In aspartate, glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5.21%, 13.55% and 21.80%, respectively in mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 when compared with seized mice. Hippocampus mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity (63.30%) when compared with seized mice. The results indicate that GFC can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals. In conclusion, our data suggest that GFC may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the GABA and glutamate contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus. This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent.;neurological;['neurological']
Acute effects of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine-induced seizure in rats.;The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA) of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea (VPU) in comparison to its parent compound, valproic acid (VPA). VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine-induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA. Pretreatment with either VPU (50 and 100 mg/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate. In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level. Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine-induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate. Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizure in experimental animals. Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated.;neurological;['neurological']

Attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride in rats.;The effect of amiloride on lithium-induced polydipsia and polyuria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with LiCl. Amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute (6 or 12 h) and a subacute (3 days) experiment. 6 h after the administration of amiloride, a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied. At 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels. After 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake. In all the experiments, the attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level. It is concluded that acute amiloride administration to lithium-treated patients suffering from polydipsia and polyuria might relieve these patients but prolonged amiloride supplementation would result in elevated lithium levels and might be hazardous.;neurological|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'hepatorenal']

Binasal visual field defects are not specific to vigabatrin.;This study investigated the visual defects associated with the antiepileptic drug vigabatrin (VGB). Two hundred four people with epilepsy were grouped on the basis of antiepileptic drug therapy (current, previous, or no exposure to VGB). Groups were matched with respect to age, gender, and seizure frequency. All patients underwent objective assessment of electrophysiological function (wide-field multifocal electroretinography) and conventional visual field testing (static perimetry). Bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 59% of patients currently taking VGB, 43% of patients who previously took VGB, and 24% of patients with no exposure to VGB. Assessment of retinal function revealed abnormal responses in 48% of current VGB users and 22% of prior VGB users, but in none of the patients without previous exposure to VGB. Bilateral visual field abnormalities are common in the treated epilepsy population, irrespective of drug history. Assessment by conventional static perimetry may neither be sufficiently sensitive nor specific to reliably identify retinal toxicity associated with VGB.;neurological;['neurological']

Increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in bladder afferent pathways following chronic bladder irritation.;"Immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine alterations in the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in bladder pathways following acute and chronic irritation of the urinary tract of the rat. Chemical cystitis was induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP) which is metabolized to acrolein, an irritant eliminated in the urine. Injection of CYP (n = 10, 75 mg/kg, i.p.) 2 hours prior to perfusion (acute treatment) of the animals increased Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) in neurons in the dorsal commissure, dorsal horn, and autonomic regions of spinal segments (L1-L2 and L6-S1) which receive afferent inputs from the bladder, urethra, and ureter. Fos-IR in the spinal cord was not changed in rats receiving chronic CYP treatment (n = 15, 75 mg/kg, i.p., every 3rd day for 2 weeks). In control animals and in animals treated acutely with CYP, only small numbers of NOS-IR cells (0.5-0.7 cell profiles/sections) were detected in the L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Chronic CYP administration significantly (P < or = .002) increased bladder weight by 60% and increased (7- to 11-fold) the numbers of NOS-immunoreactive (IR) afferent neurons in the L6-S1 DRG. A small increase (1.5-fold) also occurred in the L1 DRG, but no change was detected in the L2 and L5 DRG. Bladder afferent cells in the L6-S1 DRG labeled by Fluorogold (40 microliters) injected into the bladder wall did not exhibit NOS-IR in control animals; however, following chronic CYP administration, a significant percentage of bladder afferent neurons were NOS-IR: L6 (19.8 +/- 4.6%) and S1 (25.3 +/- 2.9%). These results indicate that neuronal gene expression in visceral sensory pathways can be upregulated by chemical irritation of afferent receptors in the urinary tract and/or that pathological changes in the urinary tract can initiate chemical signals that alter the chemical properties of visceral afferent neurons.";neurological;['neurological']

Retroviral-mediated gene transfer of human phenylalanine hydroxylase into NIH 3T3 and hepatoma cells.;Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is caused by deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . A full-length human PAH cDNA sequence has been inserted into pzip-neoSV ( X ) , which is a retroviral vector containing the bacterial neo gene . The recombinant has been transfected into psi 2 cells , which provide synthesis of the retroviral capsid . Recombinant virus was detected in the culture medium of the transfected psi 2 cells , which is capable of transmitting the human PAH gene into mouse NIH 3T3 cells by infection leading to stable incorporation of the recombinant provirus . Infected cells express PAH mRNA , immunoreactive PAH protein , and exhibit pterin-dependent phenylalanine hydroxylase activity . The recombinant virus is also capable of infecting a mouse hepatoma cell line that does not normally synthesize PAH . PAH activity is present in the cellular extracts and the entire hydroxylation system is reconstituted in the hepatoma cells infected with the recombinant viruses . Thus , recombinant viruses containing human PAH cDNA provide a means for introducing functional PAH into mammalian cells of hepatic origin and can potentially be introduced into whole animals as a model for somatic gene therapy for PKU . .;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Structure-activity and dose-effect relationships of the antagonism of picrotoxin-induced seizures by cholecystokinin, fragments and analogues of cholecystokinin in mice.;Intraperitoneal administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphate ester (CCK-8-SE) and nonsulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8-NS) enhanced the latency of seizures induced by picrotoxin in mice. Experiments with N- and C-terminal fragments revealed that the C-terminal tetrapeptide (CCK-5-8) was the active centre of the CCK octapeptide molecule. The analogues CCK-8-SE and CCK-8-NS (dose range 0.2-6.4 mumol/kg) and caerulein dose range 0.1-0.8 mumol/kg) showed bell-shaped dose-effect curves, with the greatest maximum inhibition for CCK-8-NS. The peptide CCK-5-8 had weak anticonvulsant activity in comparison to the octapeptides, 3.2 mumol/kg and larger doses of the reference drug, diazepam, totally prevented picrotoxin-induced seizures and mortality. The maximum effect of the peptides tested was less than that of diazepam. Experiments with analogues and derivatives of CCK-5-8 demonstrated that the effectiveness of the beta-alanyl derivatives of CCK-5-8 were enhanced and that they were equipotent with CCK-8-SE. Of the CCK-2-8 analogues, Ser(SO3H)7-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE and Thr(SO3H)7-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE and Hyp(SO3H)-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE were slightly more active than CCK-8-SE.;neurological;['neurological']

LPP, the preferred fusion partner gene of HMGIC in lipomas, is a novel member of the LIM protein gene family.;"A major cytogenetic subgroup of lipomas is characterized by recurrent chromosome aberrations , mainly translocations , that involve chromosome segment 12q13-q15 . Multiple chromosomes have been found as the translocation partners of chromosome 12 but 3q27-q28 is preferentially involved . In previous studies , it has been shown that the high mobility group ( HMG ) protein gene HMGIC at 12q15 is consistently rearranged as a consequence of these translocations . Here , we report the identification and characterization of the chromosome 3-derived translocation partner gene , which we have designated LPP ( lipoma preferred partner gene ) . Using 3-RACE analysis of HMGIC fusion transcripts in lipoma cell line Li-501 / SV40 , ectopic genetic sequences were obtained , which by CASH ( chromosome assignment using somatic cell hybrids ) and FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) analysis were found to originate from chromosome segment 3q27-q28 . In Northern blot analysis , an mRNA of over 10 kb was detected by these ectopic sequences in a variety of human tissues but not in brain and peripheral blood leukocytes . Upon partial cDNA cloning , features of the genetic organization of LPP were established . The gene was found to span a genomic region of over 400 kb . Nucleotide sequence analysis of a composite cDNA of LPP revealed an open reading frame of 1836 nucleotides encoding a proline-rich protein containing a leucine-zipper motif in its amino-terminal region and three LIM domains in its carboxy-terminal region . The LPP-encoded protein should be classified as a novel member of the group 3 proteins of the LIM protein gene family . Using reverse transcriptase combined with polymerase chain reactions in the analysis of a number of lipoma cell lines and primary lipomas , it appeared that LPP is frequently rearranged also in cases without a cytogenetically detectable involvement of 3q27-q28 . Two alternative HMGIC / LPP hybrid transcripts have been detected ; the difference between them is mainly the presence of either two or three LIM domains in the predicted HMGI-C / LPP fusion proteins . .";neurological;['neurological']

Immunohistochemical studies with antibodies to neurofilament proteins on axonal damage in experimental focal lesions in rat.;Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament (NF) proteins of middle and high molecular weight class, NF-M and NF-H, was used to study axonal injury in the borderzone of focal lesions in rats. Focal injury in the cortex was produced by infusion of lactate at acid pH or by stab caused by needle insertion. Infarcts in substantia nigra pars reticulata were evoked by prolonged pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Immunohistochemical staining for NFs showed characteristic terminal clubs of axons in the borderzone of lesions. Differences in the labelling pattern occurred with different antibodies which apparently depended on molecular weight class of NFs and phosphorylation state. These immunohistochemical changes of NFs can serve as a marker for axonal damage in various experimental traumatic or ischemic lesions.;neurological;['neurological']

Effect of calcium chloride and 4-aminopyridine therapy on desipramine toxicity in rats.;BACKGROUND: Hypotension is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit calcium influx in some tissues. This study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension. METHODS: Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker overdose. CaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine. Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP to produce hypotension, QRS prolongation, and bradycardia. Fifteen min later, animals received CaCl2, NaHCO3, or saline. In a second experiment, rats received tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP followed in 15 min by 4-aminopyridine or saline. RESULTS: NaHCO3 briefly (5 min) reversed hypotension and QRS prolongation. CaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine failed to improve blood pressure. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias (p = 0.004) and seizures (p = 0.03) in the CaCl2 group was higher than the other groups. CONCLUSION: The administration of CaCl2 or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension in rats. CaCl2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity. These findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension.;neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']
De novo deletions of SNRPN exon 1 in early human and mouse embryos result in a paternal to maternal imprint switch.;Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is a neurogenetic disease characterized by infantile hypotonia , gonadal hypoplasia , obsessive behaviour and neonatal feeding difficulties followed by hyperphagia , leading to profound obesity . PWS is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11-q13 ( ref . 2 ) . Five imprinted , paternally expressed genes map to the PWS region , MKRN3 ( ref . 3 ) , NDN ( ref . 4 ) , NDNL1 ( ref . 5 ) , SNRPN ( refs 6-8 ) and IPW ( ref . 9 ) , as well as two poorly characterized framents designated PAR-1 and PAR-5 ( ref . 10 ) . Imprinting of this region involves a bipartite imprinting centre ( IC ) , which overlaps SNRPN ( refs 10 , 11 ) . Deletion of the SNRPN promoter / exon 1 region ( the PWS IC element ) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to PWS . Here we report a PWS family in which the father is mosaic for an IC deletion on his paternal chromosome . The deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells . We have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem ( ES ) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion . Our studies demonstrate that the PWS IC element is not only required for the establishment of the paternal imprint , but also for its postzygotic maintenance . .;neurological;['neurological']

The hematologic effects of cefonicid and cefazedone in the dog: a potential model of cephalosporin hematotoxicity in man.;"Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man, the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized. There is a need for a well-defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied. In four subacute toxicity studies, the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose-dependent incidence of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia after 1-3 months of treatment. A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400-500 mg/kg cefonicid or 540-840 mg/kg cefazedone. All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron (approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets (hours to a few days). Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin, the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested; cefonicid (but not cefazedone)-treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period (15 +/- 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug (61 +/- 24 days). This observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia. We conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin-induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders.";neurological;['neurological']

Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer in some families . However , little is known about the contribution of BRCA1 mutations to breast cancer in the general population . We analyzed DNA samples from women enrolled in a population-based study of early-onset breast cancer to assess the spectrum and frequency of germ-line BRCA1 mutations in young women with breast cancer . METHODS . We studied 80 women in whom breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 35 , and who were not selected on the basis of family history . Genomic DNA was studied for BRCA1 mutations by analysis involving single-strand conformation polymorphisms and with allele-specific assays . Alterations were defined by DNA sequencing . RESULTS . Germ-line BRCA1 mutations were identified in 6 of the 80 women . Four additional rare sequence variants of unknown functional importance were also identified . Two of the mutations and three of the rare sequence variants were found among the 39 women who reported no family history of breast or ovarian cancer . None of the mutations and only one of the rare variants was identified in a reference population of 73 unrelated subjects . CONCLUSIONS . Alterations in BRCA1 were identified in approximately 10 percent of this cohort of young women with breast cancer . The risk of harboring a mutation was not limited to women with family histories of breast or ovarian cancer . These results represent a minimal estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 mutations in this population . Comprehensive methods of identifying BRCA1 mutations and understanding their importance will be needed before testing of women in the general population can be undertaken . .;neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']
Ataxin-3 with an altered conformation that exposes the polyglutamine domain is associated with the nuclear matrix.;"Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 or Machado-Joseph disease ( SCA3 / MJD ) is a member of the CAG / polyglutamine repeat disease family . In this family of disorders , a normally polymorphic CAG repeat becomes expanded , resulting in expression of an expanded polyglutamine domain in the disease gene product . Experimental models of polyglutamine disease implicate the nucleus in pathogenesis ; however , the link between intranuclear expression of expanded polyglutamine and neuronal dysfunction remains unclear . Here we demonstrate that ataxin-3 , the disease protein in SCA3 / MJD , adopts a unique conformation when expressed within the nucleus of transfected cells . The monoclonal antibody 1C2 is known preferentially to bind expanded polyglutamine , but we find that it also binds a fragment of ataxin-3 containing a normal glutamine repeat . In addition , expression of ataxin-3 within the nucleus exposes the glutamine domain of the full-length non-pathological protein , allowing it to bind the monoclonal antibody 1C2 . Fractionation and immunochemical experiments indicate that this novel conformation of intranuclear ataxin-3 is not due to proteolysis , suggesting instead that association with nuclear protein ( s ) alters the structure of full-length ataxin-3 which exposes the polyglutamine domain . This conformationally altered ataxin-3 is bound to the nuclear matrix . The pathological form of ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine domain also associates with the nuclear matrix . These data suggest that an early event in the pathogenesis of SCA3 / MJD may be an altered conformation of ataxin-3 within the nucleus that exposes the polyglutamine domain . .";neurological;['neurological']
Flumazenil induces seizures and death in mixed cocaine-diazepam intoxications.;STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may unmask seizures in mixed cocaine-benzodiazepine intoxication. DESIGN: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 100 mg/kg cocaine IP alone, 5 mg/kg diazepam alone, or a combination of diazepam and cocaine. Three minutes later, groups were challenged with vehicle or flumazenil 5 or 10 mg/kg IP. Animal behavior, seizures (time to and incidence), death (time to and incidence), and cortical EEG tracings were recorded. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of flumazenil to animals after they had received a combination dose of cocaine and diazepam. RESULTS: In group 1, animals received cocaine followed by vehicle. This resulted in 100% developing seizures and death. Group 2 received diazepam alone followed by vehicle. Animals became somnolent and none died. Group 3 received diazepam followed by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. Animals became somnolent after diazepam and then active after flumazenil administration. In group 4, a combination of cocaine and diazepam was administered simultaneously. This resulted in no overt or EEG-detectable seizures and a 50% incidence of death. Group 5 received a similar combination of cocaine and diazepam, followed later by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. This resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < .01), and death, 100% (P < or = .01), compared with group 4. Group 6 received cocaine and diazepam followed by 10 mg/kg flumazenil. This also resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < or = .01), and death, 90% (P < or = .05), compared with group 4. CONCLUSION: Flumazenil can unmask seizures and increase the incidence of death in a model of combined cocaine-diazepam intoxications.;neurological;['neurological']
Acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol treatments change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake and elicit orofacial dyskinesia in rats.;Reserpine- and haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive dyskinesia (TD) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress. In the present study, the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats. Reserpine injection (one dose of 1 mg/kg s.c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control. Haloperidol administration (one dose of 12 mg/kg once a week s.c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations. After the treatments and behavioral observation, glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed. A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol, compared to the control. Importantly, a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia. These results indicate that early changes in glutamate transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in rats.;neurological;['neurological']

Results of a comparative, phase III, 12-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of telmisartan and amlodipine versus amlodipine monotherapy in Indian adults with stage II hypertension.;"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new fixed-dose combination (FDC) of telmisartan 40 mg + amlodipine 5 mg (T+A) compared with amlodipine 5-mg monotherapy (A) in adult Indian patients with stage II hypertension. METHODS: This comparative, Phase III, 12-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II hypertension. Patients were treated with oral FDC of T+A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks; blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position. Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP (SBP)/ diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to study end and number of responders (ie, patients who achieved target SBP/ DBP <130/<80 mm Hg) at end of study. Tolerability was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events, identified using physical examination, laboratory analysis, and electrocardiography. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study; 203 patients (143 men, 60 women) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow-up (4 patients in the T+A group and 3 in the A group) and considered with-drawn. At study end, statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP (T+A [-27.4%]; A [-16.6%]) and DBP (T+A [-20.1%]; A [-13.3%]) (all, P < 0.05). Response rates were 87.3% (89/102) in the T+A group and 69.3% (70/101) in the A group (P < 0.05). The prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups (T+A, 16.0% [17/106]; A, 15.4% [16/104]). Peripheral edema was reported in 8.5% patients (9/106) in the T+A group compared with 13.5% (14/104) in the A group, and cough was reported in 3.8% patients (4/106) in the T+A group and 1.0% (1/104) patients in the A group; these differences did not reach statistical significance. The incidences of headache, dizziness, and diarrhea were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among these Indian patients with stage II hypertension, the FDC of T+A was found to be significantly more effective, with regard to BP reductions, than A, and both treatments were well tolerated.";cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']

Reduction in caffeine toxicity by acetaminophen.;"A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over-the-counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate, caffeine, and acetaminophen displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per mL of serum. Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen (52 micrograms/mL) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine. Studies in DBA/2J mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with acetaminophen (100 mg/kg) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine (300 to 450 mg/kg IP) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with acetaminophen (75 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine (12.5 to 75 mg/kg IP). The frequency of sound-induced seizures after 12.5 or 25 mg/kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5% by acetaminophen. In the absence of caffeine, acetaminophen (up to 300 mg/kg) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of pentylenetetrezol in mice (tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS). Acetaminophen (up to 150 micrograms/mL) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive adenosine into ATP in slices of rat cerebral cortex. Thus the mechanism by which acetaminophen antagonizes the actions of caffeine in the CNS remains unknown.";neurological;['neurological']

Gemcitabine plus vinorelbine in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma patients age 70 years or older or patients who cannot receive cisplatin. Oncopaz Cooperative Group.;"BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is high among elderly patients, few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this group of patients. Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine (VNB) or gemcitabine (GEM) may obtain a response rate of 20-30% in elderly patients, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life. In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with advanced NSCLC were included, 38 of whom were age >/= 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin. All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Treatment was comprised of VNB, 25 mg/m(2), plus GEM, 1000 mg/m(2), both on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five courses were administered, with a median of 3. 6 courses per patient. The overall response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval, 15-41%). Two patients attained a complete response (4%) and 11 patients (22%) achieved a partial response. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35% of those patients with an initial value > 0, whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients (55%). The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1-year survival rate was 33%. Toxicity was mild. Six patients (12%) had World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia, 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, and 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3 neurotoxicity. Three patients with severe neutropenia (6%) died of sepsis. The median age of those patients developing Grade 3-4 neutropenia was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients (75 years vs. 72 years; P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age >/= 75 years. This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression. Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment. New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.";neurological|oncological;['neurological', 'oncological']

Adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics. Collaborative Working Group on Clinical Trial Evaluations.;Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance. Thus, clinicians should address patients' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients' quality of life as well as overall health. The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics. Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold (primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis (clozapine only). Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals, the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual's dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']

Mechanisms of FK 506-induced hypertension in the rat.;-Tacrolimus (FK 506) is a powerful, widely used immunosuppressant. The clinical utility of FK 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity. To clarify the mechanisms of FK 506-induced hypertension, we studied the chronic effects of FK 506 on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels. In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506-induced hypertension in rats was studied. FK 506, 5 mg. kg-1. d-1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102+/-13 to 152+/-15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET-1 and the levels of ET-1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery (240% and 230%, respectively). Little change was observed in the expression of ECE-1 mRNA and CNP mRNA. FK 506 decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta (48% and 55%, respectively). The administration of FR 139317 (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented FK 506-induced hypertension in rats. These results indicate that FK 506 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET-1 production but also by decreasing NO synthesis in the vasculature.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['neurological', 'cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']

Mice lacking the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase develop a late onset progressive myopathy.;Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3 untranslated region of a putative protein kinase ( DMPK ) . To elucidate the role of DMPK in DM pathogenesis we have developed Dmpk deficient ( Dmpk- / - ) mice . Dmpk- / -mice develop a late-onset , progressive skeletal myopathy that shares some pathological features with DM . Muscles from mature mice show variation in fibre size , increased fibre degeneration and fibrosis . Adult Dmpk- / -mice show ultrastructural changes in muscle and a 50 % decrease in force generation compared to young mice . Our results indicate that DMPK may be necessary for the maintenance of skeletal muscle structure and function and suggest that a decrease in DMPK levels may contribute to DM pathology . .;neurological;['neurological']

Type III collagen is crucial for collagen I fibrillogenesis and for normal cardiovascular development.;Type III collagen is a fibrillar forming collagen comprising three alpha1 ( III ) chains and is expressed in early embryos and throughout embryogenesis . In the adult , type III collagen is a major component of the extracellular matrix in a variety of internal organs and skin . Mutations in the COL3A1 gene have been implicated as a cause of type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , a disease leading to aortic rupture in early adult life . To directly study the role of Col3a1 in development and disease , we have inactivated the Col3a1 gene in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination . The mutated allele was transmitted through the mouse germ line and homozygous mutant animals were derived from heterozygous intercrosses . About 10 % of the homozygous mutant animals survived to adulthood but have a much shorter life span compared with wild-type mice . The major cause of death of mutant mice was rupture of the major blood vessels , similar to patients with type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome . Ultrastructural analysis of tissues from mutant mice revealed that type III collagen is essential for normal collagen I fibrillogenesis in the cardiovascular system and other organs . .;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']

Cardiac transplantation: improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol.;The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients. In group I, cyclosporine was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17.5 mg/kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng/ml. In group II, cyclosporine was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by azathioprine, which was used for the first postoperative week. Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic nephrotoxicity secondary to long-term therapy with cyclosporine. Despite this improvement in late renal function, group II still shows a slow rise in serum creatinine. We think that even these lower dosages of cyclosporine can cause chronic nephrotoxicity and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;['cardiovascular', 'hepatorenal']

Localization of the region homologous to the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus on the mouse X chromosome.;Recent progress has resulted in part of the gene mutated in Duchenne and the milder Becker muscular dystrophies being cloned and has suggested that the gene itself extends over 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 kilobases ( kb ) . To study how mutations in this gene affect muscle development and integrity , it would be of interest to have available a mouse model of the human disease . The mouse mdx mutation affects muscle and confers a mild dystrophic syndrome , but it is not clear whether this mutation is equivalent to Duchenne / Becker muscular dystrophy in man . Here we describe the use of two sequences from the human Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) gene that cross-hybridize to mouse X-linked sequences to localize the gene homologous to DMD in the mouse . Both sequences map to the region of 10 centimorgan lying between the Tabby ( Ta ) and St14-1 ( DxPas8 ) loci , close to the phosphorylase b kinase locus ( Phk ) . By analogy with the human X-chromosome , we conclude that the region in the mouse around the G6pd and St14-1 loci may contain two genes corresponding to distinct human myopathies  Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which is known to be closely linked to St14-1 in man and the DMD homologue described here . .;neurological;['neurological']
Curcumin ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and oxidative damage in phenobarbitone and carbamazepine administered rats.;The antiepileptic drugs, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are well known to cause cognitive impairment on chronic use. The increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of cognitive impairment by antiepileptic drugs. Curcumin has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective properties. Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phenobarbitone- and carbamazepine-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats. Pharmacokinetic interactions of curcumin with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were also studied. Vehicle/drugs were administered daily for 21days to male Wistar rats. Passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function. At the end of study period, serum phenobarbitone and carbamazepine, whole brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estimated. The administration of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine for 21days caused a significant impairment of learning and memory as well as an increased oxidative stress. Concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs. Curcumin co-administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both phenobarbitone as well as carbamazepine. These results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration of cognitive functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum concentrations. The findings suggest that curcumin can be considered as a potential safe and effective adjuvant to phenobarbitone and carbamazepine therapy in preventing cognitive impairment associated with these drugs.;neurological;['neurological']

Pseudo-allergic reactions to corticosteroids: diagnosis and alternatives.;"Two patients treated with parenteral paramethasone (Triniol) and dexamethasone (Sedionbel) are described. A few minutes after administration of the drugs, they presented urticaria (patients 1 and 2) and conjunctivitis (patient 1). The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid. Clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and ELISA tests were performed. In the two patients, skin and ELISA tests with paramethasone were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients. A single-blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients. We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them. These results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients. Corticosteroids different from paramethasone also produced hypersensitivity reactions in these patients; however, a few of them were tolerated. The basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pseudo-allergy caused by paramethasone.";neurological;['neurological']

METHOD: Twenty-three patients suffering from severe Parkinson's disease (Stages III-V on Hoehn and Yahr scale) and, particularly bradykinesia, rigidity, and levodopa-induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the STN. Preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up, in ""on"" and ""off"" drug conditions, was carried out using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr staging, England activities of daily living score and video recordings. RESULTS: After one year of electrical stimulation of the STN, the patients' scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III) off medication improved by 62% and 61% respectively (p<0.0005). The subscores for the akinesia, rigidity, tremor and gait also improved. (p<0.0005). The average levodopa dose decreased from 813 mg to 359 mg. The cognitive functions remained unchanged. Two patients developed device-related complications and two patients experienced abnormal weight gain. CONCLUSION: Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. It reduces the severity of ""off"" phase symptoms, improves the axial symptoms and reduces levodopa requirements. The reduction in the levodopa dose is useful in controlling drug-induced dyskinesias.";neurological;['neurological']

Brain disease and molecular analysis in myotonic dystrophy.;"Abnormal amplification of a CTG repeat on chromosome 19 is the molecular basis of myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) . Expansion of the repeat has been correlated with severity of several clinical features of the disease . We performed extensive cognitive testing , cerebral magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and a molecular analysis in 28 cases of DM to determine the relationship between the molecular defect and brain disease . Performance in two or more cognitive tests was pathological in 10 cases . Fourteen patients had subcortical white matter lesions on MRI , 14 had cerebral atrophy . Amplification of the CTG repeat showed a strong correlation with cognitive test deficits when exceeding a length of over 1000 trinucleotides . MRI lesions were associated with impaired psychometric performance , but MRI and molecular findings were only weakly related . Disease duration influenced the appearance and amount of white matter lesions on MRI . Quantification of CTG repeat size may allow an early estimate on the probability of brain involvement in DM ; cognitive dysfunction is associated with white matter lesions and cerebral atrophy later on in the course . .";neurological;['neurological']
Pharmacological evidence for the potential of Daucus carota in the management of cognitive dysfunctions.;The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds (DCE) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-, scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. DCE (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23% at the dose of 200 mg/kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg/kg in young mice using elevated plus maze. Similarly, significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice. Furthermore, DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Daucus carota extract (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice. The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg/kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice. There was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well, to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of DCE. Therefore, DCE may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.;neurological;['neurological']

Diagnosis of hemochromatosis.;If untreated , hemochromatosis can cause serious illness and early death , but the disease is still substantially under-diagnosed . The cornerstone of screening and case detection is the measurement of serum transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin level . Once the diagnosis is suspected , physicians must use serum ferritin levels and hepatic iron stores on liver biopsy specimens to assess patients for the presence of iron overload . Liver biopsy is also used to establish the presence or absence of cirrhosis , which can affect prognosis and management . A DNA-based test for the HFE gene is commercially available , but its place in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis is still being evaluated . Currently , the most useful role for this test is in the detection of hemochromatosis in the family members of patients with a proven case of the disease . It is crucial to diagnose hemochromatosis before hepatic cirrhosis develops because phlebotomy therapy can avert serious chronic disease and can even lead to normal life expectancy . .;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

von Willebrand disease type B: a missense mutation selectively abolishes ristocetin-induced von Willebrand factor binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib.;von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) is a multimeric glycoprotein that mediates the adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium by binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib . For human vWF , this interaction can be induced in vitro by the antibiotic ristocetin or the snake venom protein botrocetin . A missense mutation , Gly-561-- > Ser , was identified within the proposed glycoprotein Ib binding domain of vWF in the proband with von Willebrand disease type B , a unique variant characterized by no ristocetin-induced , but normal botrocetin-induced , binding to glycoprotein Ib . The corresponding mutant recombinant protein , rvWF ( G561S ) , formed normal multimers and exhibited the same functional defect as the patients plasma vWF , confirming that this mutation causes von Willebrand disease type B . These data show that botrocetin and ristocetin cofactor activities of vWF can be dissociated by a point mutation and confirm that these mediators promote vWF binding to platelets by different mechanisms . The normal botrocetin-induced binding and the defective ristocetin-induced binding of rvWF ( G561S ) suggest that the primary defect in von Willebrand disease type B may be a failure of normal allosteric regulation of the glycoprotein Ib binding function of vWF . .;neurological;['neurological']

Rhabdomyolysis in a hepatitis C virus infected patient treated with telaprevir and simvastatin.;A 46-year old man with a chronic hepatitis C virus infection received triple therapy with ribavirin, pegylated interferon and telaprevir. The patient also received simvastatin. One month after starting the antiviral therapy, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he developed rhabdomyolysis. At admission simvastatin and all antiviral drugs were discontinued because toxicity due to a drug-drug interaction was suspected. The creatine kinase peaked at 62,246 IU/L and the patient was treated with intravenous normal saline. The patient's renal function remained unaffected. Fourteen days after hospitalization, creatine kinase level had returned to 230 IU/L and the patient was discharged. Telaprevir was considered the probable causative agent of an interaction with simvastatin according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale. The interaction is due to inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated simvastatin clearance. Simvastatin plasma concentration increased 30 times in this patient and statin induced muscle toxicity is related to the concentration of the statin in blood. In conclusion, with this case we illustrate that telaprevir as well as statins are susceptible to clinical relevant drug-drug interactions.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Central nervous system toxicity following the administration of levobupivacaine for lumbar plexus block: A report of two cases.;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Central nervous system and cardiac toxicity following the administration of local anesthetics is a recognized complication of regional anesthesia. Levobupivacaine, the pure S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, was developed to improve the cardiac safety profile of bupivacaine. We describe 2 cases of grand mal seizures following accidental intravascular injection of levobupivacaine. CASE REPORT: Two patients presenting for elective orthopedic surgery of the lower limb underwent blockade of the lumbar plexus via the posterior approach. Immediately after the administration of levobupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine 2.5 microgram/mL, the patients developed grand mal seizures, despite negative aspiration for blood and no clinical signs of intravenous epinephrine administration. The seizures were successfully treated with sodium thiopental in addition to succinylcholine in 1 patient. Neither patient developed signs of cardiovascular toxicity. Both patients were treated preoperatively with beta-adrenergic antagonist medications, which may have masked the cardiovascular signs of the unintentional intravascular administration of levobupivacaine with epinephrine. CONCLUSIONS: Although levobupivacaine may have a safer cardiac toxicity profile than racemic bupivacaine, if adequate amounts of levobupivacaine reach the circulation, it will result in convulsions. Plasma concentrations sufficient to result in central nervous system toxicity did not produce manifestations of cardiac toxicity in these 2 patients.;neurological|cardiovascular;['neurological', 'cardiovascular']

Propranolol antagonism of phenylpropanolamine-induced hypertension.;Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) overdose can cause severe hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, and death. We studied the efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of PPA-induced hypertension. Subjects received propranolol either by mouth for 48 hours before PPA or as a rapid intravenous infusion after PPA. PPA, 75 mg alone, increased blood pressure (31 +/- 14 mm Hg systolic, 20 +/- 5 mm Hg diastolic), and propranolol pretreatment antagonized this increase (12 +/- 10 mm Hg systolic, 10 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic). Intravenous propranolol after PPA also decreased blood pressure. Left ventricular function (assessed by echocardiography) showed that PPA increased the stroke volume 30% (from 62.5 +/- 20.9 to 80.8 +/- 22.4 ml), the ejection fraction 9% (from 64% +/- 10% to 70% +/- 7%), and cardiac output 14% (from 3.6 +/- 0.6 to 4.1 +/- 1.0 L/min). Intravenous propranolol reversed these effects. Systemic vascular resistance was increased by PPA 28% (from 1710 +/- 200 to 2190 +/- 700 dyne X sec/cm5) and was further increased by propranolol 22% (to 2660 +/- 1200 dyne X sec/cm5). We conclude that PPA increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of PPA on cardiac output. That propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of PPA is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of norepinephrine. This is probably because PPA has less beta 2 activity than does norepinephrine.;cardiovascular;['cardiovascular']

Effect of D-Glucarates on basic antibiotic-induced renal damage in rats.;Dehydrated rats regularly develop acute renal failure following single injection of aminoglycoside antibiotics combined with dextran or of antibiotics only. Oral administration of 2,5-di-O-acetyl-D-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone protected rats against renal failure induced by kanamycin-dextran. The protective effect was prevalent among D-glucarates, and also to other saccharic acid, hexauronic acids and hexaaldonic acids, although to a lesser degree, but not to a hexaaldose, sugar alcohols, substances inthe TCA cycle and other acidic compounds. D-Glucarates were effective against renal damage induced by peptide antibiotics as well as various aminoglycoside antibitocis. Dose-responses were observed in the protective effect of D-Glucarates. With a D-glucarate of a fixed size of dose, approximately the same degree of protection was obtained against renal damages induced by different basic antibiotics despite large disparities in administration doses of different antibiotics. D-Glucarates had the ability to prevent renal damage but not to cure it. Rats excreted acidic urine when they were spared from renal lesions by monosaccharides. The reduction effect of D-glucarates against nephrotoxicity of basic antibiotics was discussed.;hepatorenal;['hepatorenal']

Cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer--a highly aggressive disease: analysis of 12 cases.;PURPOSE: We gained knowledge of the etiology, treatment and prevention of cyclophosphamide associated urothelial cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 6 men and 6 women (mean age 55 years) with cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer were reviewed. RESULTS: All tumors were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell carcinoma. Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease. Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months. The remaining patient with extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide associated bladder tumor is an aggressive disease. However, long-term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for bladder tumors with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease, even when noninvasive.;oncological;['oncological']

Cauda equina syndrome after epidural steroid injection: a case report.;OBJECTIVE: Conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral radiculopathy are physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, oral medications, and spinal manipulative therapy. Cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia. The following case is a report of cauda equina syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 50-year-old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injection. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: An 18-gauge Touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the L4-5 level. Spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging. After verifying the epidural space, bupivacaine and triamcinolone diacetate were injected. After the injection, there was a reduction in radicular symptoms. Three hours later, she complained of perineal numbness and lower extremity weakness. The neurologic evaluation revealed loss of sensation in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg. There was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test. Deep-tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg. She was unable to urinate. The patient's symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours. She had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling Foley catheter. All of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hours. CONCLUSION: Complications associated with epidural steroid injections are rare. Clinical examination and continued vigilance for neurologic deterioration after epidural steroid injections is important.;neurological;['neurological']

Central excitatory actions of flurazepam.;Toxic actions of flurazepam (FZP) were studied in cats, mice and rats. High doses caused an apparent central excitation, most clearly seen as clonic convulsions, superimposed on general depression. Following a lethal dose, death was always associated with convulsions. Comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness, while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions. Signs of FZP toxocity in cats included excessive salivation, extreme apprehensive behavior, retching, muscle tremors and convulsions. An interaction between FZP and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was shown by pretreating mice with FZP before PTZ challenge. As a function of dose, FZP first protected against convulsions and death. At higher doses, however, convulsions again emerged. These doses of FZP were lower than those that would alone cause convulsions. These results may be relevant to the use of FZP in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability, such as epilepsy or sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal.;neurological;['neurological']

Neurocognitive and neuroradiologic central nervous system late effects in children treated on Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) P9605 (standard risk) and P9201 (lesser risk) acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocols (ACCL0131): a methotrexate consequence? A report from the Children's Oncology Group.;"Concerns about long-term methotrexate (MTX) neurotoxicity in the 1990s led to modifications in intrathecal (IT) therapy, leucovorin rescue, and frequency of systemic MTX administration in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, neurocognitive outcomes and neuroradiologic evidence of leukoencephalopathy were compared in children treated with intense central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy (P9605) versus those receiving fewer CNS-directed treatment days during intensive consolidation (P9201). A total of 66 children from 16 Pediatric Oncology Group institutions with ""standard-risk"" acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1.00 to 9.99 years at diagnosis, without evidence of CNS leukemia at diagnosis were enrolled on ACCL0131: 28 from P9201 and 38 from P9605. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and standard neuropsychological tests were performed >2.6 years after the end of treatment. Significantly more P9605 patients developed leukoencephalopathy compared with P9201 patients (68%, 95% confidence interval 49%-83% vs. 22%, 95% confidence interval 5%-44%; P=0.001) identified as late as 7.7 years after the end of treatment. Overall, 40% of patients scored <85 on either Verbal or Performance IQ. Children on both studies had significant attention problems, but P9605 children scored below average on more neurocognitive measures than those treated on P9201 (82%, 14/17 measures vs. 24%, 4/17 measures).

Probing peripheral and central cholinergic system responses.;"OBJECTIVE: The pharmacological response to drugs that act on the cholinergic system of the iris has been used to predict deficits in central cholinergic functioning due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, yet correlations between central and peripheral responses have not been properly studied. This study assessed the effect of normal aging on (1) the tropicamide-induced increase in pupil diameter, and (2) the reversal of this effect with pilocarpine. Scopolamine was used as a positive control to detect age-dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy elderly (mean age 70) and 9 young (mean age 33) volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours. The study involved 4 sessions. In 1 session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other. In another session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to both eyes, followed 23 minutes later by the application of pilocarpine (20 microL, 0.1%) to one eye and placebo to the other. All eye drops were given in a randomized order. In 2 separate sessions, a single dose of scopolamine (0.5 mg, intravenously) or placebo was administered, and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pupil size at time points after administration of tropicamide and pilocarpine; scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to tropicamide at any time point (p > 0.05). The elderly group had a significantly greater pilocarpine-induced net decrease in pupil size 85, 125, 165 and 215 minutes after administration, compared with the young group (p < 0.05). Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is an age-related pupillary response to pilocarpine that is not found with tropicamide. Thus, pilocarpine may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients.";neurological;['neurological']
